h||Introduction

t||"Land of the Gods" is Gilgamesh's story within the greater "The Fate of Mankind" Epic Quest. The story begins when you purchase Gilgamesh's Deluxe Pack for 4400 Crystals, and by progressing through the various stages, Gilgamesh reaches Tier-2.
t||This story does not bring Gilgamesh past Tier-2, so to build him further you will have to Realise Potential, Level 70, Gear 25, Awaken and Transcend Potential manually as with any other character.

t||Gilgamesh's Deluxe Mission has 4 entries per day, each of which drops 4 or 5 Gilgamesh Biometrics, and one of the six Artifacts from the list above. Character Artifacts for Thena, Gilgamesh and Kingo drop extremely rarely.
t||This entry limit also means you cannot complete the below Stage List in one day, even if you manage to complete the Search immediately, as there are multiple objectives that require you to run Shock and Awe.
t||If you run the stage on Manual, you will get two Shifter runs where Kingo will spawn.

h||Rewards
t||While the Epic Quest tells you to build Gilgamesh yourself, most of the materials needed to do so are provided in the stage rewards. These are listed below.

h||Implicit Requirements
t||While the above requirements cover most of the cost of ranking up, the costs will be listed out here. By the time you reach the end of the quest, you should have been able to run the Deluxe Mission 12 times, so you should have roughly 60 more Biometrics than what is shown above.

h||Search
t||This Epic Quest includes a single Search objective. This requires that you run a particular mission over and over to acquire some RNG drops. It is generally accepted that Search items drop at a fixed rate regardless of level (e.g. Dimension Missions having levels 1-15), so if you want to rush Search stages, run the missions with lowest Energy requirement (e.g. Dimension Mission stage 6).
