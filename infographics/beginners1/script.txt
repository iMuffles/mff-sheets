h||Introduction
t||Hello, this is my Beginner's Guide for Marvel Future Fight. This is the first of three parts, which aims to guide players through about their first month of playtime.
t||This guide has been created for Update 7.1 - "The Black Order". If this is outdated, look for a newer version at 21000dollor.com/beginners.
t||Made by DUBU, Astrospeedyjm, Ren Vader, wavegangse, Chaebae and anuswarp.

h||Character Progression
t||Character progression is very convoluted in this game. Here is a basic rundown for the majority of characters:
t||- Unlock the character.[n]- Upgrade to 6 Stars, 6 Mastery, Lv.60.[n]- Upgrade gears to +20.[n]- Upgrade to Tier-2.[n]- Realise Potential by running World Boss.[n] > For characters you really like or want to unlock a 6th skill for, Upgrade Potential and level to Lv.70.[n] > For characters you want to unlock a 6th skill for, upgrade gears to +25.[n]  > For some characters, upgrade to Tier-3.[n]  > For some characters, Awaken Potential, upgrade Awakened Skill, and Transcend Potential.
t||[n]"Native Tier-2s" follow a different levelling system, but you can worry about those later.

h||Items
t||Below are some items that will be discussed later on. A lot of these can be found in the various new player check-in events.
lp||twice||item_premochest||New Player 6-Star Premium Chest
pt||Gives a random 6-Star Premium Character.[n]You get 1 of these in your Inbox upon completing the tutorial.
lp||twice||item_6selector||6-Star Character Selector
pt||Brings a character straight to 6-Stars, though they will be Level 1 with no mastery.[n]You get 4 of these through new player login events.
lp||twice||item_premoselector||Premium 6-Star Character Selector
pt||Like the previous, but allows you to pick from a limited selection of Premium/Paywall characters.[n]You get 1 of these through a new player login event.
lp||twice||item_t2selector||Tier-2 Character Selector
pt||Brings a character striaght to Tier-2, which includes upgrading them to 6-Stars, maxing their Mastery, levelling them to 60 and upgrading gears to 20.[n]You get 1 of these through a new player login event.
lp||twice||item_mmt||6-Star Mega Mastery Ticket
pt||Upgrades a character's Mastery to 6-Stars instantly.[n]Less crucial who you use these on, as you can get Norn Stones relatively easily, but still use them wisely.
lp||twice||item_t2t||Tier-2 Advancement Ticket
pt||Upgrades a character to Tier-2, skipping the cost of the upgrade only.[n]You still need the character to be Lv.60, max Mastery, and gears at +20.[n]You get these every 28 days through the regular monthly check-in event.
lp||twice||item_mt2||Mega Tier-2 Advancement Ticket
pt||Upgrades any 6-Star character to Tier-2, regardless of Level, Mastery and Gear progress.[n]The character is automatically levelled to 60, fully Mastered and gears upgraded to +20 upon using a Mega Tier-2 Ticket.[n]Shortly after each update there is an event where you can get these, so you can get one in approximately every 5 weeks.

h||Character Selections
t||The characters I have recommended in this guide are chosen based on:
t||- Low-Spec Playability: How easy it is to play the character with subpar builds.[n]- Scalability into Endgame: How well the character fares in later-game content.[n]- Safety from Power Creep: Characters with high Defense Down and Support Passives are less likely to be power creeped.[n]
t||You can of course choose to just pick who you like, but following a guide like this and optimising your new player bonuses will allow you to more efficiently acquire your favourites in the future.  

h||Additional Resources
t||This guide focuses on your personal account progression and shouldn't be the only resource you look at. You should also check out:
t||- Part 3 of this Beginner's Guide, specifically the "Team and Character Building" and "General Tips" sections.
t||- r/future_fight's Basic Question Thread or a Discord server of your choice to ask questions.
t||- https://21000dollor.com for various game resources (including this guide).








c||(38,60,108,200)||(159,52,59)||Freebies
t||These are characters (and uniforms) that all new characters get for free by completing some starter content. 
p||blast||sharonrogers||Tier-2 Captain America (Sharon Rogers)
pt||From S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.
p||combat||captainamerica10||Tier-2 Captain America [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||speed||blackwidow7||Tier-2 Black Widow [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||blast||ironman7||Tier-2 Iron Man [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||combat||taskmaster||6-Star Taskmaster
pt||From Black Widow Legendary Battle.
p||blast||mysterio||6-Star Mysterio
pt||From Spider-Man: Far From Home Legendary Battle.
p||universal||thor||6-Star Thor
pt||From Thor: Ragnarok Legendary Battle.

t||You also get War Machine, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Spider-Man and Black Panther at 6 Stars from Legendary Battles. I have not included separate descriptions for them as I believe none of them are currently worth building for new players, but consider levelling them to Level 60 for 60 Crystals through Achievements.









c||(19,23,38,200)||(116,174,193)||Starter Characters
h||Moon Knight
t||From the start, focus on picking up Moon Knight from the Support Shop (under Dimension Missions). Rank him up manually.
p||combat||moonknight||Moon Knight (Day 7)
pt||One of the best Physical Damage characters in the game right now, while being accessible to new players.[n]Not of much use without a uniform, but hopefully by the time you rank him up you're at least close to having the 700 Crystals to afford it.[n]Amazing with the uniform alone but becomes even crazier if you Awaken and Transcend his Potential, which you can work towards gradually.

h||Recommended Picks
t||You get a free 6-Star Selector every week for 4 weeks, and on the final day of the 28-day check-in you get a Tier-2 Selector. The "days" listed in brackets refer to the day in which you should be able to claim that reward and thus a new 6-Star or Tier-2 character.
p||blast||sersi||Sersi (Day 1)
pt||An excellent starter character due to her proc-friendly rotation, high damage and two defensive buffs.[n]While she is one of the best non-uniformed Tier-2 characters in the game right now, she will only be better with an inevitable uniform and 6th skill[n][t]for the Eternals movie tie-in update.
p||universal||ironhammer||Iron Hammer (Day 7)
pt||Universal Hero that deals Energy/Lightning Damage. A solid starter character with a skill cooldown reduction lead, but doesn't scale too well into late-game.
p||blast||humantorch||Human Torch (Day 14)
pt||Blast Hero that deals Energy/Fire Damage, which might help with Ebony Maw World Boss Ultimate, and progresses you in the First Family Epic Quest.[n]Fine without a uniform while you're starting, but can prove useful in late-game with the "Classic" uniform.
p||speed||scorpion||Scorpion (Day 21)
pt||A decent Speed Villain with a satisfying rotation and decent damage.[n]Not the best character overall, but is capable of one-shotting mid-level WBU which provides some longevity into midgame.
p||speed||scarletspider||Tier-2 Scarlet Spider (Day 28)
pt||Somewhat lacking in survivability, but has excellent damage and a good support passive at Tier-2.[n]Scales pretty well in late-game, and is able to one-shot World Boss Ultimates at respectable stage numbers.[n]Also useful for the dreaded Spider-Sense floor 32 in Shadowland.


h||Build Priorities
t||Selecting these characters is one thing, knowing who to build the most is another. In order of who you should build most to least:
t|| - Moon Knight: Stack him as much as you can, as your eventual goal is to raise him to Transcended Potential.[n] - Human Torch: A fantastic character when maxed out, so give him a quality PvE build.[n] - Scarlet Spider: Give him a solid build but nothing crazy, he needs to be Level 64 for Stage 32 Shadowland.[n] - Sersi: Solid build again, but hold off on any huge investments as she'll get a new uniform with the movie.[n] - Scorpion & Iron Hammer: Give them a decent build.

h||Viable Alternatives
t||Note that none of these require a uniform to be good. 
p||combat||scream||Scream
pt||Combat Villain that deals Physical Damage, deals decent damage with an easy skill rotation. 
p||speed||darkhawk||Darkhawk
pt||Speed Hero that deals Energy Damage, and progresses you in the Galactic Imperative Epic Quest.
p||speed||viper||Viper
pt||Speed Villain that deals Physical/Poison Damage, helpful in Shadowland where Villains are needed.
p||universal||shadowshell||Shadow Shell
pt||Univeral Hero that deals Physical/Poison Damage, all-around very powerful but made redundant by better Universal Heroes.
p||universal||doctorvoodoo||Doctor Voodoo
pt||Universal Hero that deals Energy Damage, decent by himself but has a very useful leadership that you will use plenty in late-game PvE.
p||combat||wartiger||War Tiger
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical Damage, has nice healing and a Skill Cooldown lead, but lacks damage.
p||universal||morganlefay||Morgan le Fay
pt||Universal Villain that deals Energy Damage, has tons of mechanics like a revive, cooldown resets, and summons, but her damage sucks.









c||(206,233,250,200)||(94,143,162)||Free Premiums

h||Random Chest
t||Important note: You may read some old guides that mention a 3-day Bio Sub "Trial" for new players. In update 6.5 this was replaced with a random 6-Star Premium chest that you get immediately upon finishing the tutorial. This is nice because you can get some Mutant characters and you get the Premium at 6 Stars off the bat, but it's also very RNG and you could get stuck with a shitty Premium that doesn't do much for your roster.
t||It is an option to "reroll" your account by uninstalling and reinstalling to get a good first Premium - this will be pretty helpful but it's very annoying and it's understandable if you choose not to. If you are willing to spend a bit of money on the game, the starter Premium you get is not so important.
t||I have listed some of the most desirable premiums below with brief descriptions - if you do choose to reroll, I would settle if you got any of these (though they are roughly in order of quality).
p||combat||valkyrie||Valkyrie
pt||Combat Hero, another solid support character that supports all characters.[n]Also obtainable for 2500 Crystals via Legendary Battle, but I do not see this as being worth it.[n]Her "Fearless Defenders" uniform improves her support and makes her viable on her own, but it's not a priority for new players.
p||blast||gambit||Gambit
pt||Blast Hero that deals Energy Damage, an insanely good single-target PvE character with his uniform, has Awakening/Transcend Potential option.[n]If you roll Gambit, grab his "Excalibur" uniform and consider Awakening him in the long run.
p||speed||lunasnow||Luna Snow
pt||Speed Hero that deals Energy/Cold Damage, Netmarble's favourite original character, has a Tier-3 option.[n]Likely to get another uniform very soon.
p||universal||ikaris||Ikaris
pt||Universal Hero that deals Energy Damage.[n]Not bad at the moment, but you'd be getting him in anticipation of a Tier-3 and uniform for the Eternals film.
p||combat||carnage||Carnage
pt||Combat Villain that deals Physical Damage, strong but power crept with his uniform, has Tier-3 option.
p||universal||ghostpanther||Ghost Panther
pt||Universal Hero that deals Physical/Fire Damage, primarily used for support though he will be useful on his own early on.
p||speed||nickfury1||Nick Fury
pt||Speed Hero that deals Physical Damage, okay on his own but otherwise is the best support character for heroes in the game.[n]Also obtainable for 2500 Crystals via Legendary Battle, but I do not see this as being worth it.
p||blast||dazzler||Dazzler
pt||Blast Hero that deals Energy Damage, a leadership character for Mutants with a nice support skill that can be transferred to other characters.

h||Selector
t||On the 7th day new players get to select a 6-Star Premium character. This selector only has a limited pool of characters and includes no Mutants. Below are the two recommended choices.
p||speed||lunasnow||Luna Snow
pt||A very strong character at Tier-3, but requires late-game Custom Gear (CTP of Rage/Judgement) to truly excel.[n]At 6-Star with no uniform, no good CTP and not even Tier-2, she is not too impressive.[n]However with a uniform likely coming soon, she remains a possibility if you like her.
p||universal||ikaris||Ikaris
pt||Same as with the Random Chest - if you get Ikaris it's in the hopes he will be very strong with the movie release.[n]You can build him somewhat as-is, as he's not bad for lower-level content, but don't invest heavily until the Eternals update.




c||(35,44,78,200)||(255,114,250)||First Uniforms
t||In your first month of play you should be able to farm around 4000 Crystals from check-in events, daily challenges, and achievements for levelling characters. 
t||The below uniforms should cost 1750 Crystals (700 + 1050), where the 700 cost comes from the new player first uniform discount. This gives you another uniform's worth of spare Crystals on top - you can spend this on Sharon's uniform if you want, Gambit's if you rolled him, or save it for a Deluxe Pack or CTP.
t||NEVER buy a uniform unless it is on sale. All uniforms go on a 40% sale at least once per update cycle, so depending on when you start, you may have to be patient. 
h||Recommended Picks
p||combat||moonknight2||Moon Knight [Mr. Knight]
pt||Necessary for Moon Knight to be good.[n]If you are following the recommended starter characters, try and buy this by day 7 with the new player discount.
p||speed||falcon4||Captain America (Sam Wilson) [Marvel Studios' The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]
pt||Necessary for Falcon to be good.[n]Rank up Falcon with the Guided Quest and grab this uniform when it's on sale.[n]Provides a tremendous damage boost that makes Falcon one of the best PvE characters in the game.
p||combat||taskmaster1||Taskmaster [Marvel Studios' Black Widow]
pt||Grab this uniform whenever you have the spare Crystals.[n]Taskmaster himself isn't too impressive, you're mainly buying this for the uniform passive support.[n]Taskmaster remains relevant into late-game as he has a Tier-3, allowing you to bring him into more content.
h||Viable Alternatives
p||blast||sharonrogers3||Sharon Rogers [Star Night Armor]
pt||No doubt an amazing uniform and for a character that you are given as a Tier-2 no less, vastly increasing her damage and adding a Heal.[n]However I am hesitant to recommend buying it right now as OC characters like Sharon tend to get yearly new uniforms.[n]Star Night was released last January, so it might be better to wait for a new uniform instead of buying this and having it be outdated in a few months.
p||blast||humantorch2||Human Torch [Classic]
pt||Decent without, but a huge upgrade for Human Torch nonetheless.[n]Keeps his skillset quite similar, but vastly boosts his damage output.[n]Not as much of a priority, but worth getting when you have the Crystals and there is a sale.
p||blast||gambit1||Gambit [Excalibur]
pt||Grab this uniform only if you got Gambit in your Premium Hero Chest. Makes Gambit better in basically every way.

h||Gold Uniforms
t||A number of older uniforms became available for 500,000 Gold in the 7.0 update. 
t||Below are the "must-have" Gold uniforms.
p||blast||sharonrogers1||Sharon Rogers [Star Light Armor]
pt||Not as good as her newer uniforms, but much better than her base outfit.[n]Worth getting if you are going to wait for a new uniform for her to come out.
p||speed||groot2||Groot [Guardians of the Galaxy 2]
pt||An excellent support character, providing a team heal passive at Tier-2.[n]Also extremely valuable as a World Boss Striker, as he leaves healing pods behind when he appears.
p||blast||doctorstrange1||Doctor Strange [Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange]
pt||Adds some stats and a heal to his 2nd skill. Very useful, since Strange is usable in Shadowland even at low ranks.
p||blast||ancientone1||Ancient One [Marvel Studios' Ancient One]
pt||A very nice Lead/Support character and Shadowland clearer.[n]This uniform changes her to Female, allowing her to enter various content gated from Males.
p||universal||vision1||Vision [Avengers: Age of Ultron]
pt||Changes Vision to Universal type. Good until you get his WandaVision uniform.
p||universal||destroyer1||Destroyer [Prometheus]
pt||Adds some bonus stats and Crowd Control. Any amount helps.
p||combat||shehulk1||She-Hulk [All-New]
pt||Adds 5% more damage to her excellent leadership. 

t||Additionally, a number of Gold-cost uniforms are less necessary, but still very nice for Shadowland clears. They are listed below with less elaborate descriptions.
p||blast||starlord2||Star-Lord [Guardians of the Galaxy 2]
pt||Boosts his lead from 45% to 50% as well as adding a nice 4th skill and smooth rotation.
p||speed||wintersoldier2||Winter Soldier [Captain America]
pt||By instant cancelling 3 before using each other skill, you can gain 100% uptime on Damage Immunity.
p||combat||redhulk1||Red Hulk [Marvel NOW!]
pt||Switches him to Hero, allowing him to be used in more content.
p||universal||ronan1||Ronan [Annihilation]
pt||Adds some more Crowd Control debuffs for Shadowland.
p||speed||silk1||Silk [Web Suit]
pt||Adds longer Web duration for Shadowland.
p||speed||elsabloodstone2||Elsa Bloodstone [Monsters Unleashed! (MFF Variant)]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.
p||combat||ironfist3||Iron Fist [Marvel Studios' Iron Fist]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.
p||combat||punisher3||Punisher [Marvel Studios' Daredevil]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.
p||blast||yellowjacket1||Yellowjacket [Marvel NOW!]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.

c||(16,16,24,200)||(175,26,92)||Guided Quest
t||Guided Quest allows you to pick 10 characters total, one at a time, from a pool of 21 characters. For each character, you complete a series of challenges for some rewards and to raise your character to Tier-2. For this reason, you shouldn't rank up any of the below characters manually, as you'll want to let the Guided Quest do that for you.
t||Additionally, the Guided Quest offers a specific uniform for the character you've chosen at a 50% discount - a deal that only comes twice a year for most other uniforms. Below are the 10 characters you should get from Guided Quest, categorised based on whether their uniforms are worth getting.
h||Must-Cop Uniforms
t||For these characters you absolutely do want to buy their uniforms. If you can't afford their uniform yet, just keep the Guided Quest open and don't start another one until you buy it.
t||It might be best to not run all of these in a row - do some other Guided Quests for characters you won't get the uniforms for, then come back to one of these characters once you have enough.
p||speed||daredevil3||Daredevil [Fall From Grace]
pt||Your early-game (and possibly late-game) PvP carry.[n]An excellent hybrid PvE/PvP character that you can build for either mode.
p||universal||vision3||Vision [Marvel Studios' WandaVision]
pt||Super strong PvE character with great animations.[n]Has a pretty nice leadership too.

h||Optional Uniforms
t||These uniforms are still quality, but not must-haves. You might get these if you like any particular uniform or character, or if you're not shy about spending money on bonus Crystals.
t||They are ranked from best to worst.
p||universal||ghostrider3||Ghost Rider [King of Hell]
pt||One of the best Universal Heroes and overall PvE characters in the game considering the cost.[n]However, he needs a CTP of Rage or Judgement to excel, which are difficult to get for new players.
p||combat||ironfist4||Iron Fist [The Living Weapon]
pt||Fresh looking uniform with nice damage and a great leadership for Defenders.[n]Moon Knight is the better Combat Hero overall, but Iron Fist isn't too far behind.
p||universal||thor8||Thor [Herald of Thunder]
pt||An all-around solid uniform with nice animations and damage.[n]Useful for World Boss with a good build, but there are better Universal Heroes.
p||universal||blackbolt3||Black Bolt [Marvels X]
pt||Like Thor, but slightly worse.
p||combat||venom3||Venom [War of the Realms]
pt||A decent Combat Hero with a nice heal striker support (drops blobs that heal you when you run over them).[n]Really nice for Alliance Battle Extreme but not too useful in general outside of that.

h||No Uniforms
t||Don't buy the 50% off uniforms for these characters.
p||speed||shuri||Shuri
pt||You're building her for her support passive which only gets mildly boosted by her uniform.[n]Provides a 35% damage boost against Villains for all allies at Tier-2.
p||speed||falcon||Falcon
pt||Get him to Tier-2, but don't purchase the Guided Quest uniform.[n]Instead, buy the "FATWS" uniform recommended in the First Uniforms section.
p||universal||loki||Loki
pt||Get him to Tier-2 in anticipation of a "Loki" TV show uniform.
p||blast||wasp||Wasp
pt||Get her to Tier-2 for her debuff removal support passive, which is very handy in Timeline.

c||(83,59,75,200)||(170,43,134)||Support Shop Grinds
t||The following characters' Biometrics or X-Genes can be purchased from the Support Shop in Dimension Missions.

h||Decent Mains
t||Build these up to Tier-2, but don't expect them to be as good as the starter characters in the section above.
p||speed||angel||Angel
pt||Darkhawk lite. Really good all-around with a fantastic uptime on damage immunity, but his damage is dated.
p||blast||bishop||Bishop
pt||Decent character in both PvE and PvP, but not amazing in any regard.
p||combat||warpath||Warpath
pt||Good damage, but squishy. Very nice in Shadowland rumbles.
p||blast||mysterio||Mysterio
pt||You are already given him at 6-Star through Legendary Battle, so it's worth getting him to Tier-2 for Shadowland, which he is decent in.[n]Purchasing the uniform is also an option but shouldn't be a priority.
p||blast||crystal||Crystal
pt||Excellent crowd control character, making her useful for low levels of Shadowland even without a uniform.

h||Uniform-Required Characters
t||These characters are easily farmable in the Support Shop like the above ones, but require a uniform to be viable. You should only build these up if you have plans to buy the uniforms - for higher-paying beginners or for further down the road.
p||combat||moonknight2||Moon Knight [Mr. Knight]
pt||As mentioned before, Moon Knight is insane with his uniform all the way to late-game.
p||speed||spidergwen2||Spider-Gwen [Gwenom]
pt||A cheap Speed Villain, which is useful for Squad Battle and Alliance Battle Extreme.[n]Easy-to-play with visually stunning animations, and could be somewhat viable in early PvP too.

h||Leads and Supports
t||These characters aren't great as mains, but have useful Leaderships or Support Passives that make them worth building.
p||blast||philcoulson||Phil Coulson
pt||Increases Guaranteed Critical Rate by 20% and Damage to Villains by 45% for Heroes at Tier-2.[n]An incredibly useful passive for a character so cheap.
p||universal||destroyer||Destroyer
pt||An excellent off-meta PvP character that scales well even into late-game.[n]Not much of a "main" but you let him sit there and most Energy Damage opponents melt themselves.
p||combat||shehulk||She-Hulk
pt||Leadership that increases damage dealt to Male characters by 48% (scales up with uniforms).[n]Damage leaderships are usually much better than attack-based ones.[n]She is also likely to get a Tier-3 for the She-Hulk TV show in the future.
p||combat||warwolf||Warwolf
pt||Increases Guaranteed Critical Rate by 20% and Critical Damage by 30% for all allies at Tier-2.[n]Decently useful passive for characters with low Crit stats.
p||blast||ancientone||Ancient One
pt||Dual lead/support. Leadership provides +45% Energy Attack for Blasts, and support provides +25% Elemental Damage and Ignore Dodge.[n]Also useful on his/her own in Shadowland Rumbles.
p||universal||medusa||Medusa
pt||Leadership that increases All Attacks by 36% for Universals.[n]Decent on her own in Shadowland, much improved with her "Inhumans vs X-Men" uniform, but that's not really worth buying anymore.
p||blast||mantis||Mantis
pt||Increases Critical Damage by 20% and Ignore Defense by 15% for all allies at Tier-2.[n]A nice early-game support, and a valuable Shadowland Rumble character due to her ability to keep enemies AoE fear-locked.

c||(202,219,227,200)||(251,166,251)||Selectors and Tickets
t||Especially in early-game, you get a ton of various Selectors and Tickets (other than the 6-Star / Tier-2 / Premium Selectors relevant to earlier sections). Below are recommendations on which characters to use them on.

h||Mastery Tickets
p||twice||mysterio||Mysterio
pt||Skill Cooldown Reduction leadership is incredibly important.[n]Use a Mega Mastery Ticket on Mysterio (who you get free at 6 Stars from Legendary Battle).[n]Any other Mastery Tickets you can just use on who you want.

h||Norn Stone Selectors
p||speed||greennorn||Norn Stones of Brilliance
pt||Again, not that important, but most of the new player characters are Speed Type so you might need more of these than the other types.

h||Biometric Selectors
t||Most of these will be used on characters you have used 6-Star Selectors on, as on average 166 Biometrics are needed to upgrade gears to +20, which is a prerequisite to Tier-2 Advancement.
p||twice||sersi||General Selectors: Sersi
pt||You want to rush her to Tier-2.[n]Once you've done that, use general selectors on the other characters listed below.
p||combat||scream||Combat-Type Selectors: Scream
pt||For building her up from scratch, if you did not choose her as a Viable Alternative.
p||blast||sersi||Blast-Type Selectors: Sersi
pt||For upgrading gears to +20 to unlock Tier-2 Advancement.
p||speed||scorpion||Speed-Type Selectors: Scorpion
pt||For upgrading gears to +20 to unlock Tier-2 Advancement.
p||universal||shadowshell||Universal-Type Selectors: Shadow Shell
pt||For ranking her up - she is a solid early-game Universal Female Hero that may get a powerful uniform sometime soon.

h||X-Gene / Mutant Selectors
p||blast||kidomega||Kid Omega
pt||The best non-farmable Mutant character, and the cheapest way to clear Floor 34.[n]Try to get him to Tier-2.
p||speed||rogue||Rogue
pt||A really powerful character with her "Excalibur" uniform, Tier-3, and a C.T.P. of Judgement.[n]While she is farmable at about 10 X-Genes a day, using Selectors on her can speed up the process if you have a Judgement to spare for her[n][t](or can get one soon).

h||Tier-2 Tickets
t|| - Regular Tier-2 Tickets should be used on characters like Moon Knight, Sersi, Scarlet Spider and Spider-Gwen.[n] - Mega Tier-2 Tickets should be used on Premiums like Carnage, Gambit and Luna Snow.


c||(253,185,246,200)||(135,35,71)||Comic Cards
t||Comic Cards are boring and overly RNG-dependent but still remains the most important part of roster building as they affect your entire roster. 
h||Starter Set
t||Your aim should be to as quickly as possible build a deck of cards that brings your Skill Cooldown stat to the 28-32% range - combined with a 14% max Alliance bonus and you can effectively cut all your characters' cooldowns in half. This is essential as characters are designed with capped (50%) Skill Cooldown in mind.
t||To achieve this, create a bunch of the 5 cards below at 4-Stars - if the stats aren't right, make another 4-Star copy and repeat until it's good enough to equip. You can only equip one of each variety of card at once.
lp||twice||card_loki||LOKI: AGENT OF ASGARD #17
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: All Attack, Skill Cooldown.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed respectively.
lp||twice||card_mz||MARVEL ZOMBIES #2
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Dodge, Skill Cooldown.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Critical Damage, Ignore Defense respectively.
lp||twice||card_nebula||AVENGERS (1963) #318
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Max HP, Ignore Defense.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: All Attack, Skill Cooldown respectively.
lp||twice||card_groot||GROOT (2015) #5
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Critical Damage, Ignore Defense.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Energy Attack, Skill Cooldown respectively.
lp||twice||card_punisher||THE PUNISHER #19
pt||Obtainable from Card Chests, which can be purchased in the Dimension Mission Support Shop.[n]Fixed Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Critical Damage, Skill Cooldown respectively.
t||This is quite a scrappy deck but once you have the baseline of 28-32% Skill Cooldown, you can work on optimising them.
