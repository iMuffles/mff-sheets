h||Introduction
t||Hello, this is my Beginner's Guide for Marvel Future Fight. This is the first of three parts, which aims to guide players through about their first month of playtime.
t||This guide has been created for Update 8.4.5b - "Halloween: Fallen Soul". If this is outdated, look for a newer version at 21000dollor.com/beginners.
t||Made by DUBU, Astrospeedyjm, Ren Vader, wavegangse, Chaebae and anuswarp.



c||(187,177,137,200)||(28,28,36)||Basic Information||7.7_spidey
h||Character Progression
t||Character progression is very convoluted in this game. Here is a basic rundown for the majority of characters:
t||- Unlock the character.[n]- Upgrade to 6 Stars, 6 Mastery, Lv.60.[n]- Upgrade gears to +20.[n]- Upgrade to Tier-2.[n]- Realise Potential by running World Boss.[n] > For characters you really like or want to unlock a 6th skill for, Upgrade Potential and level to Lv.70.[n] > For characters you want to unlock a 6th skill for, upgrade gears to +25.[n]  > For some characters, upgrade to Tier-3.[n]  > For some characters, Awaken Potential, upgrade Awakened Skill, and Transcend Potential.
t||[n]"Native Tier-2s" follow a different levelling system, but you can worry about those later.

h||Items
t||Below are some items that will be discussed later on. A lot of these can be found in the various new player check-in events.
lp||twice||item_premochest||New Player 6-Star Premium Chest
pt||Gives a random 6-Star Premium Character.[n]You get 1 of these in your Inbox upon completing the tutorial.
lp||twice||item_6selector||6-Star Character Selector
pt||Brings a character straight to 6-Stars, though they will be Level 1 with no mastery.[n]You get 4 of these through new player login events.
lp||twice||item_premoselector||Premium 6-Star Character Selector
pt||Like the previous, but allows you to pick from a limited selection of Premium/Paywall characters.[n]You get 1 of these through a new player login event.
lp||twice||item_t2selector||Tier-2 Character Selector
pt||Brings a character striaght to Tier-2, which includes upgrading them to 6-Stars, maxing their Mastery, levelling them to 60 and upgrading gears to 20.[n]You get 1 of these through a new player login event.
lp||twice||item_mmt||6-Star Mega Mastery Ticket
pt||Upgrades a character's Mastery to 6-Stars instantly.[n]Less crucial who you use these on, as you can get Norn Stones relatively easily, but still use them wisely.
lp||twice||item_t2t||Tier-2 Advancement Ticket
pt||Upgrades a character to Tier-2, skipping the cost of the upgrade only.[n]You still need the character to be Lv.60, max Mastery, and gears at +20.[n]You get these every 28 days through the regular monthly check-in event.
lp||twice||item_mt2||Mega Tier-2 Advancement Ticket
pt||Upgrades any 6-Star character to Tier-2, regardless of Level, Mastery and Gear progress.[n]The character is automatically levelled to 60, fully Mastered and gears upgraded to +20 upon using a Mega Tier-2 Ticket.[n]Shortly after each update there is an event where you can get these, so you can get one in approximately every 5 weeks.

h||Character Selections
t||The characters recommended in this guide are chosen based on:
t||- Low-Spec Playability: How easy it is to play the character with subpar builds.[n]- Scalability into Endgame: How well the character fares in later-game content.[n]- Safety from Power Creep: Characters with good Leaderships and Support Passives are less likely to be power creeped.[n]
t||You can of course choose to just pick who you like, but following a guide like this and optimising your new player bonuses will allow you to more efficiently acquire your favourites in the future.  

h||Additional Resources
t||This guide focuses on your personal account progression and shouldn't be the only resource you look at. You should also check out:
t||- Part 3 of this Beginner's Guide, and the "Team Building" and "General Tips" sections of Part 4.
t||- r/future_fight's Basic Question Thread or a Discord server of your choice to ask questions.
t||- 21000dollor.com for various game resources (including this guide).






c||(38,60,108,200)||(159,52,59)||Freebies||misc_sharon
t||These are characters (and uniforms) that all new characters get for free by completing some starter content. 
p||blast||sharonrogers||Tier-2 Captain America (Sharon Rogers)
pt||From S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.
p||combat||captainamerica10||Tier-2 Captain America [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||speed||blackwidow7||Tier-2 Black Widow [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||blast||ironman7||Tier-2 Iron Man [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||blast||sersi||Tier-2 Sersi
pt||From "The Fate of Mankind" Epic Quest - granted when starting the "A Modern Crisis" story.
p||speed||spiderman||6-Star Spider-Man
pt||From Avengers: Infinity War Legendary Battle.
p||combat||taskmaster||6-Star Taskmaster
pt||From Black Widow Legendary Battle.
p||blast||mysterio||6-Star Mysterio
pt||From Spider-Man: Far From Home Legendary Battle.
p||universal||janefoster||6-Star Thor (Jane Foster)
pt||From Thor: Love and Thunder Legendary Battle.

t||Thor, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, War Machine, Shang-Chi and Black Panther can also be recruited at 6 Stars from other Legendary Battles. Separate descriptions for these characters are not included as none of them are currently worth building for new players, but go through and recruit them anyway, and consider levelling them to Level 60 for 60 Crystals through Achievements.






c||(108,69,74,200)||(116,189,232)||Starter Characters||4.4_ironhammer
h||Non-Selector Characters
t||The below characters should be acquired and worked on. They are easily acquirable from other areas, so Selectors are not advised to be used on them.
p||speed||spiderman||Spider-Man
pt||Get him at 6-Star from Legendary Battle, then work on Tier-2 with Support Shop Biometrics.[n]With the Integrated Suit uniform, he'll be your PvP carry for a long time, and is also a great PvE character.
p||combat||kamalakhan||Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)
pt||Farm her Biometrics from the Dimension Mission Support Shop, and rank her up manually.[n]Note that her uniform changes her to Speed type, and is one of the best PvE Tier-3s once you get her there.
p||combat||venom||Venom
pt||Get him at Tier-2 through Guided Quest, then work on gears with Support Shop Biometrics.[n]With his uniform, he's one of the best Combats in the game and is able to be levelled past Lv.70.
p||universal||janefoster||Thor (Jane Foster)
pt||Get her at 6-Star from Legendary Battle, then work on Tier-2 with Support Shop Biometrics.[n]With the Love and Thunder uniform, she's a very strong PvE character, and having a good Universal is quite important.
p||blast||sersi||Sersi
pt||Work through the Epic Quest Prologue for "The Fate of Mankind", then start Sersi's story, "A Modern Crisis", to recruit her at Tier-2.[n]An excellent starter character due to her proc-friendly rotation, high damage and two defensive buffs.
p||combat||sif||Sif [Optional]
pt||Farm her Biometrics from the Dimension Mission Support Shop, and rank her up manually.[n]With her uniform, she's an incredibly versatile PvE character.[n]However, you might not want to build her (yet) if you don't want to buy her Uniform, as there are others of a higher priority.

h||Weekly Selector Characters
t||You get a free 6-Star Selector every week for 4 weeks, and on the final day of the 28-day check-in you get a Tier-2 Selector. The "days" listed in brackets refer to the day in which you should be able to claim that reward and thus a new 6-Star or Tier-2 character.
p||universal||ironhammer||Iron Hammer (Day 1)
pt||Universal Hero that deals Energy/Lightning Damage. A solid starter character with a skill cooldown reduction lead, but doesn't scale too well into late-game.
p||speed||kingo||Kingo (Day 7)
pt||Speed Hero that deals Energy Damage. An easy-to-play, proc-friendly character that works without his movie uniform.
p||blast||katy||Katy (Day 14)
pt||Speed Hero that deals Physical Damage. Another overall solid character with a pretty basic (but still useful) team support passive that unlocks just at 4-Stars.[n]Additionally, if you are a fan of Shang-Chi, she provides an excellent Leadership specifically to boost his attack.
p||speed||scorpion||Scorpion (Day 21)
pt||A decent Speed Villain with a satisfying rotation and decent damage.[n]Not the best character overall, but is capable of one-shotting mid-level WBU which provides some longevity into midgame.
p||speed||scarletspider||Tier-2 Scarlet Spider (Day 28)
pt||Somewhat lacking in survivability, but has excellent damage and a good support passive at Tier-2.[n]Scales pretty well in late-game, and is able to one-shot World Boss Ultimates at respectable stage numbers.[n]Also useful for the dreaded Spider-Sense floor 32 in Shadowland.

h||Additional Selector Characters
t||Start going through and selecting these characters with future Biometric or Character Selectors (once you're done with the Weekly Selector Characters). Note that none of these require a uniform to be usable. 
p||combat||scream||Scream
pt||Combat Villain that deals Physical Damage, deals decent damage with an easy skill rotation.[n]Note that her Silence uniform is actually quite good if you like her,[n][t]but is not a priority and thus will not be mentioned in the rest of the guide.
p||speed||darkhawk||Darkhawk
pt||Speed Hero that deals Energy Damage, and progresses you in the Galactic Imperative Epic Quest.
p||speed||viper||Viper
pt||Speed Villain that deals Physical/Poison Damage, helpful in Shadowland where Villains are needed.
p||universal||shadowshell||Shadow Shell
pt||Univeral Hero that deals Physical/Poison Damage, all-around very powerful but made redundant by better Universal Heroes.
p||universal||doctorvoodoo||Doctor Voodoo
pt||Universal Hero that deals Energy Damage, decent by himself but has a very useful leadership that you will use plenty in late-game PvE.
p||combat||wartiger||War Tiger
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical Damage, has nice healing and a Skill Cooldown lead, but lacks damage.
p||universal||morganlefay||Morgan le Fay
pt||Universal Villain that deals Energy Damage, has tons of mechanics like a revive, cooldown resets, and summons, but her damage sucks.









c||(206,233,250,200)||(94,143,162)||Free Premiums||misc_luna

h||Random Chest
t||Immediately upon finishing the tutorial, you get a 6-Star Premium Hero Chest. While a nice gift, it's also very random and you could get stuck with a shitty Premium that doesn't do much for your roster.
t||It is an option to "reroll" your account by uninstalling and reinstalling to get a good first Premium - this will be pretty helpful but it's very annoying and it's understandable if you choose not to. If you are willing to spend a bit of money on the game, the starter Premium you get is not so important.
t||Listed below are some of the most desirable premiums below with brief descriptions - if you do choose to reroll, settle if you got any of these (though they are roughly in order of quality).
p||combat||valkyrie||Valkyrie
pt||Combat Hero, another solid support character that supports all characters.[n]Also obtainable for 2500 Crystals via Legendary Battle, but this likely isn't worth it for most players.[n]If you do unlock her, consider getting her Love and Thunder uniform (elaborated on in the First Uniforms section below).
p||speed||lunasnow||Luna Snow
pt||Speed Hero that deals Energy/Cold Damage, Netmarble's favourite original character, has a Tier-3 option.[n]Explained more in the "Selector" section to avoid redundancy.
p||combat||crescent||Crescent
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical Damage, another original character, has a Tier-3 option.[n]Explained more in the "Selector" section to avoid redundancy.
p||blast||echo||Echo
pt||Blast Hero that deals Physical/Fire Damage, that turns into a Speed Hero that deals Physical Damage with her uniform.[n]Her lead and support also changes from Fire/Elemental to Speed-type specific, making her a very versatile support character.
p||combat||namor||Namor
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical Damage.[n]Namor isn't very useful right now, but it's quite likely that his new uniform for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will make him relevant once more.
t||The characters listed below here are considerably less useful than the ones above, as they do not have 6th skills and are unlikely to get them anytime soon. If you are rerolling your Premium Chest, think twice about keeping the ones below (but they're still a lot better than the options not listed at all).
p||speed||nickfury1||Nick Fury
pt||Speed Hero that deals Physical Damage, okay on his own but otherwise is the best support character for heroes in the game.[n]Also obtainable for 2500 Crystals via Legendary Battle, but this is not worth it for the majority of characters.[n]Will definitely get a uniform and 6th skill with the Secret Invasion TV show, if not earlier.
p||blast||ironheart||Ironheart
pt||Blast Hero that deals Energy Damage, with a pretty good leadership.[n]If you do keep her, it'd be in the hopes that she gets a good rework soon, either with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (possible) or her own TV show (guaranteed).[n]In her current state she is completely useless outside her leadership skill.
p||blast||dazzler||Dazzler
pt||Blast Hero that deals Energy Damage, a leadership character for Mutants with a nice support skill that can be transferred to other characters.
p||universal||ghostpanther||Ghost Panther
pt||Universal Hero that deals Physical/Fire Damage, primarily used for support though he will be useful on his own early on.

h||Selector
t||On the 7th day new players get to select a 6-Star Premium character. This selector only has a limited pool of characters and includes no Mutants. The recommendation(s) are below.
p||speed||lunasnow||Luna Snow
pt||A usable character at Tier-3 with her latest uniform, but requires late-game Custom Gear (CTP of Rage/Judgement) to truly excel.[n]You would mostly be picking her in the hopes that she gets a new, better uniform soon, as she is largely not worth building as of now.
p||combat||crescent||Crescent
pt||Decent on her own, but has a really nice leadership that can be a huge help in lategame content.[n]Like Luna, she is an original character who is likely to get future uniforms (and her current ones aren't recommended).
p||blast||ironheart||Ironheart
pt||Similar reasoning to above - you'd get her if Luna and Crescent don't interest you at all, and hoping that she becomes good soon.

h||Don't get Carnage
t||Don't get Carnage. He is not good.
p||combat||carnage||Carnage
pt||Hi guys, Carnage here. Don't get me, I am not good. Even with my new uniform.

c||(115,202,221,200)||(178,86,63)||First Uniforms||8.2_jane
t||In your first month of play you should be able to farm around 4000 Crystals from check-in events, daily challenges, and achievements for levelling characters. 
t||The first uniform you buy will cost 700 Crystals, and future 40% discount uniforms cost 1050. You should be able to buy all the uniforms in the "Recommended Picks" section below, with some left over (which you can use on the "Viable Alternatives", or save up for other things in "Part 2 - Future Crystal Investments").
t||NEVER buy a uniform unless it is on sale. All uniforms go on a 40% sale at least once per update cycle, so depending on when you start, you may have to be patient. 
t||Assume that all the below characters are only usable or useful with the below uniforms - the uniform makes the character. 
h||Recommended Picks
p||speed||spiderman8||Spider-Man [Spider-Man: No Way Home (Integrated Suit)]
pt||An amazing hybrid uniform, making Spidey very capable in PvE and an absolute beast in PvP - one of the best even in late-game.[n]While his "Black & Gold" uniform is better for PvE, Integrated Suit's superior PvP performance makes it a better choice,[n][t]as most of the other recommendations in this guide are pure PvE characters.  
p||speed||kamalakhan3||Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan) [Marvel Studios' Ms. Marvel]
pt||Changes Ms. Marvel to Speed type, and makes her one of the best PvE characters even into late-game.[n]Her rotation is very simple and deals a ton of damage.
p||combat||venom4||Venom [King in Black]
pt||A very strong PvE uniform, with great animations and a ton of damage.[n]With a T4 available, he can be brought past level 70 to easily beat WBLs and Dispatch Missions later on.
p||universal||janefoster1||Thor (Jane Foster) [Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder]
pt||A great PvE character, required for Jane to be useful.[n]Works with a proc but also serves as an introduction to a more complex skill rotation, which is helpful.

h||Viable Alternatives
p||combat||valkyrie2||Valkyrie [Marvel Studios' Thor: Love and Thunder]
pt||A fantastic uniform that buffs Valkyrie's support and makes her a viable proc-friendly main at the same time.[n]Only get this uniform if you have Valkyrie at 6 Stars however - wait until you do have her there if not.
p||combat||sif2||Sif [Asgard Invasion]
pt||A solid uniform for new players: a cheap support shop character that's a lead, support and main all in one.[n]You can build her all the way up to late-game and she will still be very useful, with her support capabilities providing future-proofing against power creep.

h||Gold Uniforms
t||Some old uniforms are available for 500k Gold. Below are the "must-have" Gold uniforms.
p||blast||sharonrogers1||Sharon Rogers [Star Light Armor]
pt||Not as good as her newer uniforms, but much better than her base outfit.[n]Worth getting for her while you wait for a new uniform (her current ones are out of date).
p||speed||groot2||Groot [Guardians of the Galaxy 2]
pt||An excellent support character, providing a team heal passive at Tier-2.[n]Also extremely valuable as a World Boss Striker, as he leaves healing pods behind when he appears.
p||blast||doctorstrange1||Doctor Strange [Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange]
pt||Adds some stats and a heal to his 2nd skill. Very useful, since Strange is usable in Shadowland even at low ranks.
p||blast||ancientone1||Ancient One [Marvel Studios' Ancient One]
pt||A very nice Lead/Support character and Shadowland clearer.[n]This uniform changes her to Female, allowing her to enter various content gated from Males.
p||universal||vision1||Vision [Avengers: Age of Ultron]
pt||Changes Vision to Universal type.
p||universal||destroyer1||Destroyer [Prometheus]
pt||Adds some bonus stats and Crowd Control. Any amount helps.
p||combat||shehulk1||She-Hulk [All-New]
pt||Adds 5% more damage to her excellent leadership. 

t||Additionally, a number of Gold-cost uniforms are less necessary, but still very nice for Shadowland clears. They are listed below with less elaborate descriptions.
p||blast||starlord2||Star-Lord [Guardians of the Galaxy 2]
pt||Boosts his lead from 45% to 50% as well as adding a nice 4th skill and smooth rotation.
p||speed||wintersoldier2||Winter Soldier [Captain America]
pt||By instant cancelling 3 before using each other skill, you can gain 100% uptime on Damage Immunity.
p||combat||redhulk1||Red Hulk [Marvel NOW!]
pt||Switches him to Hero, allowing him to be used in more content.
p||universal||ronan1||Ronan [Annihilation]
pt||Adds some more Crowd Control debuffs for Shadowland.
p||speed||silk1||Silk [Web Suit]
pt||Adds longer Web duration for Shadowland.
p||speed||elsabloodstone2||Elsa Bloodstone [Monsters Unleashed! (MFF Variant)]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.
p||combat||ironfist3||Iron Fist [Marvel Studios' Iron Fist]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.
p||combat||punisher3||Punisher [Marvel Studios' Daredevil]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.
p||blast||yellowjacket1||Yellowjacket [Marvel NOW!]
pt||Nice skills for Shadowland.

c||(16,16,24,200)||(175,26,92)||Tier-2 Guided Quest||6.9_daredevil
t||Tier-2 Guided Quests allow you to pick 10 characters total, one at a time, from a pool of 21 characters. For each character, you complete a series of challenges for some rewards and to raise your character to Tier-2. For this reason, you shouldn't rank up any of the below characters manually, as you'll want to let the Guided Quest do that for you. 
t||Once you complete all ten Tier-2 Guided Quests (or if you run out of characters in the pool that are not Tier-2 before then), a single Tier-3 Guided Quest will be available (more on this in Part 2 of the Beginner's Guide).
t||Additionally, the Guided Quest offers a specific uniform for the character you've chosen at a 50% discount. Don't fall into this trap - these uniforms are all outdated, and for the majority of players, not worth buying even with this discount.
t||There are more than 10 recommendations provided here, so there is some leeway for personal preference. It is recommended you get all of the "Main Recommendations" and then pick and choose your favourites from the "Futureproofing" section.

h||Character Pool
t||Listed below are the 21 possible characters you can choose. They are listed with the uniforms that are offered with the Guided Quest (again, not worth for most).
colimg||(loki4,universal)||(hulk6,combat)||(venom3,combat)||(falcon3,speed)||(hawkeye4,speed)||(shuri1,speed)||(rocketraccoon3,blast)||(groot3,combat)||(yondu2,speed)||(wasp2,blast)||(vision3,universal)||(ghostrider3,universal)||(blade2,combat)||(thor8,universal)||(doctoroctopus2,speed)||(daredevil3,speed)||(blackbolt3,universal)||(antman3,speed)||(ironfist4,combat)||(spiderman5,speed)||(milesmorales2,combat)

h||Main Recommendations
t||Do the Guided Quests for these characters but don't buy the uniforms - the various reasonings are listed in the descriptions for each.
p||combat||venom||Venom
pt||Build him to Tier-2 and purchase his "King in Black" uniform.[n]He should be one of your primary characters.
p||speed||shuri||Shuri
pt||You're building her for her support passive, which provides her team a 35% damage boost against Villains at Tier-2.[n]She is also guaranteed to get a new uniform and 6th skill for the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever update this November.
p||blast||vision||Vision
pt||A rare character that's somewhat decent without a uniform, good enough for some Shadowland floors.[n]Grab his "Avengers: Age of Ultron" uniform, which costs Gold, to turn him Universal.
p||blast||wasp||Wasp
pt||Get her to Tier-2 for her debuff removal support passive, which is very handy in Timeline.[n]She is also guaranteed to get a new uniform and 6th skill for the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania update in February 2023.
p||combat||groot||Groot
pt||Get the Guardians of the Galaxy 2 uniform (which costs Gold, not Crystals) and use him as a Striker in World Boss.[n]When he strikes, he will leave behind healing pods, which are useful if you are struggling to stay alive.

h||Futureproofing
t||Listed below are characters in the pool who are only worth picking up in anticipation of new uniforms for movie/TV tie-in updates in the future.
p||speed||antman||Ant-Man
pt||Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (February 2023)[n]Uniform guaranteed as he is a lead character.
p||blast||rocketraccoon||Rocket Raccoon
pt||Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (May 2023)[n]Uniform highly likely, but not guaranteed (e.g. Drax did not get a uniform for Vol. 2).
p||combat||groot||Groot
pt||Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (May 2023)[n]Uniform highly likely, but not guaranteed (e.g. Drax did not get a uniform for Vol. 2).
p||speed||milesmorales||Spider-Man (Miles Morales)
pt||Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (June 2023)[n]Uniform not guaranteed since ATSV is a Sony movie, but he did get one for the first movie.
p||speed||daredevil||Daredevil
pt||Echo (Summer 2023) & Daredevil: Born Again (Spring 2024)[n]Might get a uniform for Echo, but will definitely get one for his own show regardless.
p||universal||loki||Loki
pt||Loki Season 2 (Summer 2023)||Uniform highly likely, but not guaranteed as there is no precedent for second season tie-ins.

c||(83,59,75,200)||(170,43,134)||Support Shop Grinds||2.1_moonknight
t||The following characters' Biometrics or X-Genes can be purchased from the Support Shop in Dimension Missions. Note that you should finish building whatever characters you can get from the Support Shop in the "Starter Characters" section before working through the ones below.

h||Decent Mains
t||Build these up to Tier-2, but don't expect them to be as good as the starter characters in the section above.
p||speed||angel||Angel
pt||Darkhawk lite. Really good all-around with a fantastic uptime on damage immunity, but his damage is dated.[n]Also has a debuff immunity leadership, so he's a good choice for a PvP leader early-game.
p||blast||bishop||Bishop
pt||Decent character in both PvE and PvP, but not amazing in any regard.
p||combat||warpath||Warpath
pt||Good damage, but squishy. Very nice in Shadowland rumbles.
p||blast||mysterio||Mysterio
pt||You are already given him at 6-Star through Legendary Battle, so it's worth getting him to Tier-2 for Shadowland, which he is decent in.
p||blast||crystal||Crystal
pt||Excellent crowd control character, making her useful for low levels of Shadowland even without a uniform.

h||Leads and Supports
t||These characters aren't great as mains, but have useful Leaderships or Support Passives that make them worth building.
p||combat||shehulk||She-Hulk
pt||Leadership that increases damage dealt to Male characters by 48% (scales up with uniforms).[n]Damage leaderships are usually much better than attack-based ones.[n]She also has a Tier-3 Advancement, allowing her to remain a useful lead into late-game content.
p||blast||philcoulson||Phil Coulson
pt||Increases Guaranteed Critical Rate by 20% and Damage to Villains by 45% for Heroes at Tier-2.[n]An incredibly useful passive for a character so cheap.
p||universal||destroyer||Destroyer
pt||An excellent off-meta PvP character that scales well even into late-game.[n]Not much of a "main" but you let him sit there and most Energy Damage opponents melt themselves.
p||combat||warwolf||Warwolf
pt||Support that increases Guaranteed Critical Rate by 20% and Critical Damage by 30% at Tier-2.[n]Decently useful passive for characters with low Crit stats.
p||universal||hela||Hela
pt||Leadership that increases Energy Attack by 45%.
p||combat||gorgon||Gorgon
pt||Leadership that increases Physical Attack by 45%.
p||blast||ancientone||Ancient One
pt||Leadership that increases Energy Attack by 45% for Blasts.[n]Also has a support that increases Elemental Damage and Ignore Dodge by +25% at Tier-2.[n]Additionally, a good Shadowland Rumble clearer, and a solid Striker for World Boss.
p||blast||starlord||Star-Lord
pt||Leadership that increases Energy Attack by 45% for Blasts.[n]His "Guardians of the Galaxy 2" uniform costs 500k Gold, and increases the lead to +50%.[n]He is also required at Tier-2 for "The Galactic Imperative" Epic Quest, so he should be built to Tier-2 eventually.
p||blast||moongirl||Moon Girl
pt||Leadership that increases All Attacks by 36%.
p||universal||ronan||Ronan
pt||Leadership that increases All Attacks and All Defenses by 36% for Universals.[n]Also has a support that increases Ignore Dodge by 20% at Tier-2.
p||universal||medusa||Medusa
pt||Leadership that increases All Attacks by 36% for Universals.[n]Decent on her own in Shadowland, much improved with her "Inhumans vs X-Men" uniform, but that's not really worth buying anymore.
p||blast||mantis||Mantis
pt||Support that increases Critical Damage by 20% and Ignore Defense by 15% for all allies at Tier-2.[n]A nice early-game support, and a valuable Shadowland Rumble character due to her ability to keep enemies AoE fear-locked.
p||universal||robbiereyes||Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)
pt||Leadership that increases Ignore Dodge by 50%.[n]Useful for World Bosses or Shadowland floors with high Dodge, and may be somewhat useful in Dispatch.

c||(202,219,227,200)||(251,166,251)||Selectors and Tickets||misc_nico
t||Especially in early-game, you get a ton of various Selectors and Tickets (other than the 6-Star / Tier-2 / Premium Selectors relevant to earlier sections). Below are recommendations on which characters to use them on.

h||Mastery Tickets
p||twice||mysterio||Mysterio
pt||Skill Cooldown Reduction leadership is incredibly important.[n]Use a Mega Mastery Ticket on Mysterio (who you get free at 6 Stars from Legendary Battle).[n]Any other Mastery Tickets you can just use on who you want.

h||Norn Stone Selectors
p||speed||greennorn||Norn Stones of Brilliance
pt||Again, not that important, but most of the new player characters are Speed Type so you might need more of these than the other types.

h||Biometric Selectors
t||Most of these will be used on characters you have used 6-Star Selectors on, as on average 166 Biometrics are needed to upgrade gears to +20, which is a prerequisite to Tier-2 Advancement.
p||twice||kingo||General Selectors: Kingo
pt||You want to rush him to Tier-2.[n]Once you've done that, use general selectors on the other characters listed below.
p||combat||scream||Combat-Type Selectors: Scream
pt||For building her up from scratch, if you did not choose her as a Viable Alternative.
p||blast||hydroman||Blast-Type Selectors: Hydro-Man
pt||For ranking him up - he is a solid early-game Blast Villain who shines in Shadowland.
p||speed||kingo||Speed-Type Selectors: Kingo
pt||For upgrading gears to +20 to unlock Tier-2 Advancement.
p||universal||shadowshell||Universal-Type Selectors: Shadow Shell
pt||For ranking her up - she is a solid early-game Universal Female Hero that may get a powerful uniform sometime soon.

h||X-Gene / Mutant Selectors
p||blast||kidomega||Kid Omega
pt||The best non-farmable Mutant character, and the cheapest way to clear Floor 34.[n]Try to get him to Tier-2.

h||Tier-2 Tickets
t|| - Regular Tier-2 Tickets should be used on characters like Sersi and Scarlet Spider.[n] - Mega Tier-2 Tickets should be used on Premiums like Luna Snow.


c||(253,185,246,200)||(135,35,71)||Comic Cards||misc_cat
t||Comic Cards are boring and overly RNG-dependent but still remains the most important part of roster building as they affect your entire roster. 
h||Starter Set
t||Your aim should be to as quickly as possible build a deck of cards that brings your Skill Cooldown stat to the 28-32% range - combined with a 14% max Alliance bonus and you can effectively cut all your characters' cooldowns in half. This is essential as characters are designed with capped (50%) Skill Cooldown in mind.
t||To achieve this, create a bunch of the 5 cards below at 4-Stars - if the stats aren't right, make another 4-Star copy and repeat until it's good enough to equip. You can only equip one of each variety of card at once.

pt||Obtainable from Card Chests, which can be purchased in the Dimension Mission Support Shop.[n]Fixed Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Critical Damage, Skill Cooldown respectively.
t||This is quite a scrappy deck but once you have the baseline of 28-32% Skill Cooldown, you can work on optimising them. 

c||(112,79,153,200)||(51,51,84)||Build Priorities||7.9_kate
t||This section lists all the important characters outlined in this section (including some optional ones, so you may not have all of them), along with how much you should build them. For more information on how to build characters look at Part 3 of this guide.
h||Stacked Builds
colimg||(spiderman8,speed)||(kamalakhan3,speed)||(venom4,combat)||(janefoster1,universal)||(valkyrie2,combat)
t||Build these as much as you can - e.g. your best Obelisks, ISOs, etc. - these will be the main characters you use throughout the game. As they all have 6th skills, they are viable into late-game.
h||Decent Builds
colimg||(sif2,combat)||(sersi,blast)||(scarletspider,speed)||(katy,speed)||(ironhammer,universal)||(kingo,speed)||(scorpion,speed)
t||Build these with decent (but not great) resources, as they are quite useful early-game. Don't put too much into them as most of them don't scale too well late-game (e.g. some of them have no 6th skills, so they cannot even enter World Boss Legend), so after a certain point you will have little use for them anymore.
h||Low-Level Builds
colimg||(sharonrogers1,blast)||(angel,speed)||(bishop,blast)||(warpath,combat)||(ironman7,blast)||(captainamerica10,combat)||(blackwidow7,speed)
t||These are mostly just Shadowland characters for now. Put some kind of proc obelisk on them so they deal more damage, but don't worry too much about them.

h||C.T.P. Priorities
t||When you get certain C.T.P.s, these are the characters you are recommended to put them on.
p||twice||ctp_energy||C.T.P. of Energy
subp||speed||kamalakhan3||0||no
subp||universal||janefoster1||1||no
subp||combat||valkyrie2||2||yes
t||Energy is a PvE C.T.P. best on characters who are "proc-friendly", meaning most of their damage can align nicely on a single-skill "proc" Custom Gear effect. Sharon, Jane Foster, Kamala Khan and Moon Knight are some of the primary examples of this.

p||twice||ctp_destruction||C.T.P. of Destruction
subp||speed||spiderman8||0||no
subp||universal||janefoster1||1||yes
t||Destruction is a nice hybrid PvE/PvP C.T.P. as it adds penetration to characters who don't have it, while also having the damage proc of a PvE character. As Spidey has utility in both PvE and PvP, it is recommended for him; Jane Foster can also make use of it but purely for PvE, and it would need to be Reforged to be useful.

p||twice||ctp_rage||C.T.P. of Rage
subp||combat||venom4||0||no
subp||blast||doctorstrange4||1||yes
t||Rage is a PvE C.T.P. that gives a persistent damage increase, meaning it always lasts the full 5 seconds regardless of whether a skill ends or is cancelled. Characters who have rotations that are difficult to play with a regular proc are ideal for this.

p||twice||ctp_judgement||C.T.P. of Judgement
pt||
t||Judgement is a rare C.T.P. that gives a persistent Elemental Damage increase - you can think of it as an elemental-specific version of a Rage. There are currently no characters advisable to put a Judgement on considering its rarity: hopefully someone good comes around in the next few updates.

p||twice||ctp_insight||C.T.P. of Insight
subp||combat||taskmaster1||0||no
subp||combat||sif2||1||yes
t||Insight is a support C.T.P. that renders the character it's placed on quite useless, but adds a buff for the whole team. Because of this it's best on characters who aren't ideal as mains, but already have existing support passives that Insight will add on top of.

p||twice||ctp_regeneration||C.T.P. of Regeneration
subp||universal||thanos4||0||yes
t||Regeneration is a PvP C.T.P., ideal for making tanky characters even more so. No cheap new player characters fit this description, so save it for someone you'll build later (e.g. Thanos).

p||twice||ctp_authority||C.T.P. of Authority
subp||speed||spiderman8||0||no
subp||universal||thanos4||1||yes
t||Authority is another PvP C.T.P., but works on characters who aren't that tanky either (e.g. a pure-PvP Spider-Man). If you want Spidey built for hybrid purposes though, save it for later characters (again, like Thanos).
