h||Introduction
t||Welcome to the THANO$VIB$ Beginner's Guide! This is the last of four parts, which provides some tips and resources that you can refer to from various points in your progression.
t||This guide has been created for Update 9.4 - "Midnight Suns". If this is outdated, look for a newer version at thanosvibs.money/beginners.
t||Made by DUBU, Astrospeedyjm, Ren Vader, wavegangse, Chaebae and anuswarp.
webt||On the web version of this guide (and any THANO$VIB$ guides like this) you can click or tap on any character portrait for more information about that character.




c||(255,98,230,200)||(167,10,51)||Team Building||8.6_marvelgirl
t||In this game, most teams should be comprised of "lead / main / support". This is generally much more effective than simply stacking 3 characters you like or have built well in the same team with no other thought put into it. This section provides an overview of how teams should be built for various uses.

h||PvE Team Building
t||In PvE, the main goal of building a team is to maximise the damage of a single "Main" (or "Dealer") character, through a Lead and Support character that will augment the Main's abilities. Let's look at an example you could build early on.
teamimg||(shuri2,speed)||(shehulk1,combat)||(philcoulson,blast)
p||combat||shehulk1||Leader: She-Hulk [All-New]
pt||The middle character is always the Lead. She-Hulk's Leadership Skill with her [All-New] uniform (available for Gold) is a 55% damage increase to Male enemies.[n]As a lot of bosses in the game are Male, this is a very useful general PvE Leadership.
p||speed||shuri2||Main/Support: Shuri [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever]
pt||The position of the left and right characters don't really matter, but conventionally the Main (the character you actually use in the fight) is on the left.[n]Shuri is a fantastic main, but note that she also has a Support passive of her own, so she also acts as a Support for herself.
p||blast||philcoulson||Support: Phil Coulson
pt||The rightmost character is usually a Support. Phil Coulson is completely useless on his own, but provides a solid Damage to Villains buff that helps Shuri deal more damage.

t||A team like this should be built for most of the characters in "Characters - The Main Cast" (in Part 1 of this guide) - exceptions being the support-only ones.

h||PvP Team Building
t||Building teams for PvP is very different, as the focus of PvP teams (and the characters within) are on defensive abilities such as damage reduction, HP and Dodge. A "Debuff Immunity" passive is also crucial, so if the Main does not have that ability innately (most don't), a Lead or Support is usually included to provide that immunity.
t||Let's look at a solid first PvP team.
teamimg||(spiderman10,speed)||(wasp1,blast)||(shuri1,speed)
p||blast||wasp1||Leader/Support: Wasp
pt||While Wasp is in the Leader slot, her main purpose here is to provide Debuff Immunity through her Tier-2 Passive.[n]She's placed in the Leader slot purely because hers is less useless than the other two.
p||speed||spiderman10||Main: Spider-Man
pt||Spider-Man has a great kit for PvP, making him a natural main.
p||speed||shuri2||Support: Shuri
pt||Shuri's support once again comes in useful, as it also provides a 40% damage reduction against Villains.[n]Though it is not the focus, her damage buff against Villains also doesn't hurt.
t||Additionally, in PvP it's more common to find teams composed of two or even three Mains - this might be ideal if you:[n]- don't have one single PvP character stacked[n]- don't have many PvP supports available[n]- simply prefer having more characters to play with.
t||Captain America, as mentioned in Part 1, is a decent hybrid (PvE/PvP) character, so another viable team might exclude Shuri. 
teamimg||(spiderman10,speed)||(wasp1,blast)||(captainamerica13,combat)


h||Thematic Teams
t||This section is included because a lot of players like to build teams around team bonuses. Team bonuses hardly matter in this game (and pale in comparison to the buffs of a good Lead and Support) and there is no intrinsic benefit to grouping characters who are buddies in the comics or whatever. 
t||However, thematic groupings are sometimes good if the Lead/Support buffs an attribute specific to the Main, which has become quite common. For example, take this Warriors of the Sky (WotS) team:
teamimg||(shadowshell1,speed)||(bluedragon1,blast)||(sunbird1,speed)
p||blast||bluedragon1||Lead/Main: Blue Dragon
pt||Blue Dragon can work as her own Main in both PvE and PvP depending on the build.[n]Her Leadership also provides both PvE and PvP buffs for teammates that are Warriors of the Sky:[n][t]65% All Basic Attacks, and Debuff Immunity respectively.
p||speed||shadowshell1||Main/Support: Shadow Shell
pt||Shadow Shell is a solid main, but also provides a defensive support passive to the Warriors of the Sky:[n][t]50% All Basic Defenses and 25% Damage Reduction.
p||speed||sunbird1||Support: Sun Bird
pt||Sun Bird is fine on his own, but not as good as the other two. His main draw is his (also WotS-specific) Passive, which allows any of them to revive when killed.[n]He also has an Artifact Exclusive Skill that adds additional buffs to the Warriors of the Sky. 
t||This is a rarer example of a PvE team with two mains. This mostly happens when a gamemode has tight character restrictions where there are not enough good Supports, so it is better to swap between two Mains. Usually at least one of these Mains is a Transcended character, since their 6th skills cool down while tagged out (whereas Tier-3s need to be actively using skills to charge theirs).
t||Please note that this specific example is just an example - it is not recommending you build this team specifically. Build teams based around the characters recommended in Part 1 and Part 2 of the guide - avoid these thematic teams until later.

h||Additional Information
t||1. Characters with support passives will always apply their support, regardless of the slot they are in. If a character with a good leadership and good support (e.g. Sif) is in the lead slot, both the lead and support will apply (but only the support if not in the lead).
t||2. By default, the leader character will be the first to enter the fight. To start missions with a non-leader character first, use the "Set Dealer" feature.
imgt||3. Lists of characters with good leads and supports can be found on thanosvibs.money/supports, where the "Notable Lead", "Notable Support" and "New Player Picks" filters are useful. The "Support Shop Grinds" section in Part 1, and the "Tier-3 and Transcending" section in Part 2 of this guide also recommend some useful leads and supports.
webt||3. Lists of characters with good leads and supports can be found on the "Leads & Supports" page, where the "Notable Lead", "Notable Support" and "New Player Picks" filters are useful. The "Support Shop Grinds" section in Part 1, and the "Tier-3 and Transcending" section in Part 2 of this guide also recommend some useful leads and supports.

h||Premium Cards for PvP
t||Note that for the majority of players, this game is PvE-focused, and you would be better off building your card deck for PvE. With the exception of the "GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY - BEST STORY EVER" card, which is good in both PvE/PvP, the below cards are not considered good for the majority.

h||Card Tips
t||1. Keep on the lookout for "Semi-Premium" cards to complete Card Collections. These will appear in the Item Shop in Dispatch Missions for Crystals. You can view a list of semi-premium cards on thanosvibs.money/lookups/cards.
t||2. When rolling Premium Cards, just keep in mind that Attack rolls of any kind are preferable. If a Premium has 2 possible Attack rolls on two different slots, you should probably roll for both of them.
t||3. If you have the Crafting Cubes, it doesn't hurt to Craft a card before you reroll its regular stats. The two systems are completely independent of one another.

c||(240,199,135,200)||(163,141,81)||Important Gamemodes||8.3_juggernaut
h||Daily Tasks
t||Each day, you should be trying to complete the following (listed in order of importance). Most of this is on the Status Board which you can aim to just clear out daily as well.
p||twice||thanos||World Boss
pt||The main source of Tier-2 and Tier-3 mats early-game.[n]Work towards clearing Ultimate difficulty, and once you're there you can play any boss, preferably the "Boss of the Day" for bonus rewards.[n]You may also consider starting to clear the challenges for the mutant World Bosses to work towards unlocking World Boss Legend.
lp||twice||mode_ab||Alliance Battle (+ Extreme)
pt||Drops a bunch of random rewards, but most importantly, Awakening/Transcending materials.[n]Clear Normal once a day and score as high as you can in Extreme - it's not very hard to score enough to claim the Awakening materials.
lp||twice||mode_gbr||Giant Boss Raid
pt||A good source of Premium Card Tokens, 600 of which can be exchanged for a Premium Card.[n]It is advised to play Master Mold only: there is no real point in running Galactus.
lp||twice||mode_rift||Dimension Rifts
pt||The main source of Card Crafting Cubes, which are very important mid-to-late game.[n]Clear 2 rifts to completion each day: you get 350 Cubes for your first completion and 400 for your second.
lp||twice||mode_dm||Dimension Missions
pt||Play to get Support Tokens, Gold (first reward) and random X-Genes (8th reward).[n]Do 40 runs a day at the highest level you can auto clear for a total 8 reward acquisitions.
p||twice||loki5||Multiverse Invasion
pt||A good source of Gold.[n]Play as much as you can each day.
lp||twice||mode_tl||Timeline Battle
pt||The only source of Glory Tokens, and gives a Crystal payout each week based on your rank.[n]Play 10 matches a day: even if you lose, you get some Glory Tokens back.
lp||twice||mode_eqm||Epic Quest Missions
pt||Missions that you unlock through Epic Quests are usually worth running for a variety of materials.[n]The ones that drop Mutant materials (Phoenix Feathers, M'Kraan Crystals) are particularly important.

h||Weekly Tasks
t||Similar to the above section, but weekly instead of daily.
lp||twice||mode_cheer||Timeline Challenger Cheer
pt||The only source of Advanced Glory Tokens, which should be exchanged for Awakening materials.[n]Check the reddit post on r/future_fight shortly before weekly reset to know who to cheer for.
lp||twice||mode_sl||Shadowland
pt||Drops a bunch of great rewards, and is the main source of Biometric Selectors.[n]Work through as much as you can each week, stopping at Floor 35 once you get there.[n]Also a really nice way to gauge your roster's development and your various characters' capabilities.
p||twice||jessicajones||Heroic Quest
pt||Drops a bunch of random rewards.[n]Have one free one (Jessica Jones, Luke Cage or Iron Fist) running in the background, and consider doing White Fox and Wave's premium ones at some point.

h||Late-Game Daily Tasks
t||Not really beginner material, but once you have a handful of characters with 6th skills and decent cards, start looking at doing these too. This is mainly aimed towards someone who has just unlocked these modes and won't be doing amazingly at them yet.
p||twice||knull||World Boss: Legend
pt||Drops more of everything than Ultimate does (except specific books) with Tier-4 Materials on top.[n]There's very little reason to play WBU once you can do WBL 5 times a day.
lp||twice||mode_abl||Alliance Battle: Legend
pt||Scoring high doesn't matter too much (though the Tier-3 Materials are nice as you climb) - just do enough to get the bonus Awakening Materials.
lp||twice||mode_story||Story Mode Ultimate
pt||A great way to boost your Titan Component Pack and Essence of Dimension income.[n]There's also some other arguably useful rewards thrown in, and a tiny chance at CTPs, Odin's Blessings and Premium Cards.
p||twice||dormammu||Giant Boss Raid: Dormammu
pt||The only way to get Souls of the Faltine, which are required for Tier-4.[n]Your best bet would be to find some friends who are willing to carry you if you are not around 10% Pierce yet.

c||(106,19,10,200)||(250,199,9)||General Tips||5.4_magik

h||Things to Avoid
t||This is a mobile game so there's plenty of ways you can ruin your own progress. Avoid these things at all costs:
t||1. Do not pay Crystals in the Shop to unlock any Native Tier-2s (none of them are worth it, some like Surfer can be gotten for free)
t||2. Do not pay Crystals in the Shop to unlock random Tier-2 characters (you can do this for free)
t||3. Do not pay Crystals to expand your inventory (just clear out your junk)
t||4. Do not gamble for Cards/C.T.Ps unless you plan on spending a lot on the game
t||5. Do not pay for Team slots 4 and 5 or extra ISO-8 slots
t||6. Do not use Rank Up Tickets and Uniform Tickets on characters who are not Premium
t||7. Unless you are rich, do not buy anything outside of the Stark Stash, Biometric/X-Gene Sub, Heroic Quest Crystals, and Dollar Store Crystals
t||8. I like Wolverine too but he is not good in this game

h||Character Building Tips
t||1. Do not follow the "top ranking" character builds when building your own characters. Character Ranking is an awful system that incentivises subpar builds for the sake of clout. If you are unsure of how to build a character, ask for advice, do not follow ranked builds.
t||2. Energy/Physical *Attack* and Energy/Physical *Damage* are two different things. Attack is a character stat that is used to calculate Damage, which is what is dealt during gameplay.
t||3. The vast majority of characters only depend on a single Attack stat (either Physical or Energy). They may have skills that deal a combination of Physical and Energy Damage, but these skills will scale off the same primary Attack stat. The character's primary Attack stat is the one shown under their level bar when you inspect them under "Team", and you should upgrade this Attack stat only (e.g. when deciding what Uru to equip).
t||4. Elemental Damage (i.e. Mind, Lightning, Fire, Cold, Poison) is a modifier, not a distinct damage type. All Elemental Damage has an underlying Physical or Energy Damage stat which is not shown in the skill description. This is important to understand when dealing with Reflect characters and certain PvE stage restrictions (e.g. Ebony Maw World Boss Ultimate is only weak against Elemental/Energy Damage, while Elemental/Physical Damage is ineffective).
t||5. Don't level random characters past Lv.60. Focus on 1-2 good ones at a time and take them all the way to 70. Prioritise getting characters that you plan to Tier-3 or Transcend Potential to Lv.70.
t||6. The 10% method for Enhancing Potential is far superior - you spend about half the materials as the 100% method, with a minor increase to Gold cost. There is about an 86% chance you save materials by using the 10% method, as you need to fail 19 times in a row in order to spend more materials than you would doing the 100% method.


h||Miscellaneous Tips
lp||twice||misc_starkstash||Tony Stark's Stash
pt||If you are willing to spend a bit of money, purchase the Stark Stash as often as you can.[n]Compared to anything else in the shop, it is by far the best Crystal deal and will allow you to progress significantly faster.
lp||twice||misc_codename||Codename Changer
pt||Use your codename changer in your inventory if you haven't already to select a username.
lp||twice||misc_alliance||Alliances
pt||Join a Level 30 Alliance for the stat boosts.[n]Try find one that is active with nice people who can give you advice.[n]There are enough Alliances out there that you shouldn't have to settle for a shitty one.
lp||twice||misc_defdown||World Boss Ultimate Mechanics
pt||Learn about Defense Down mechanics and the World Boss Ultimate/Legend "Resist" mechanic.

c|| || ||Update and Sales Schedules||9.4_nico
t||This section details the various schedules of updates and important sales you should be aware of.
h||Major and Minor Updates
t||Updates in the game are split into major updates and minor updates.
p||twice||nova||Major Updates
pt||Major updates (also known as "main updates") always require several hours of downtime and an App Store update.[n]These usually have much more substantial additions (e.g. gamemode changes, quality of life changes).[n]They bring the version number up by .1 (e.g. 9.4, 9.5, 9.6 are all major updates).
p||twice||samalexander||Minor Updates
pt||Minor updates (also known as "mid-months") add additional content in between major updates.[n]These are usually just adding new uniforms and character advancements, and do not require downtime the majority of the time.[n]These are numbered by an additional .5 to the version number (e.g. the minor update after update 9.4 is 9.4.5).
h||Yearly Update Schedule
t||The game usually fits 10 updates in a year, with the anniversary update being the next whole number version update (e.g. 9.0 for Anniversary 2023, 10.0 for Anniversary 2024). Thus, there are 10 major updates every 52 weeks of the year.
t||Most major updates are 5 weeks apart. With these standard updates, the minor update will come 2 weeks after the major update. There will then be a 3-week gap between the minor update and the next major update.
t||To make 52 weeks, there are 2 major updates each year which are 6 weeks apart. In these update cycles, there are two minor updates (also known as "double mid-months"). The first comes two weeks after the major update, then another two weeks until the second mid-month, then two more weeks to the next major update.
t||This website denotes double mid-month version numbers as "x.y.5a" and "x.y.5b". For example, update 9.1 had two mid-months after it, which we refer to as 9.1.5a and 9.1.5b.
h||Uniform Sales
t||Uniform sales are aligned with the update schedules, so understanding the previous section is important.
t||When an update comes out, it will at the very least have a sale on the new uniforms of that update, and their uniform options. The optional uniforms are hard to predict, so these are usually not regarded as proper sales.
t||The final mid-month of the update cycle will also come with an "all uniform sale", which puts all standard uniforms on sale. For most updates, there is only a single mid-month, so the all uniform sale comes out 2 weeks after the main update. For double mid-months, the second mid-month has the uniform sale, which is 4 weeks from the main update.
t||Standard uniform sales are 40% off - both for the new uniform sales, and the all uniform sales. 50% uniform sales only come around twice a year, during Anniversary and Black Friday.
h||Anniversary and Black Friday
t||These are the two biggest events of the game, most notably arriving alongside 50% uniform sales, and a bunch of other events, sales and offers.
lp||twice||event_anniv||Anniversary
pt||Anniversary is in late-April, often coinciding with the major MCU tie-in update of the year, and celebrates the game's anniversary.[n]This is always the x.0 update (e.g. 9.0, 10.0).
lp||twice||event_bf||Black Friday
pt||Black Friday usually aligns with the actual date of Black Friday (which you can Google) in late November.[n]This is usually around update x.5 (e.g. 9.5.5 in 2022).
h||Seasonal Uniform Events
t||Four times a year, specific "seasonal" uniforms are released. These release two at a time, and are unavailable at other times of year. When a seasonal event comes around, all the previous uniforms for that season also become available again (e.g. Christmas 2022 uniforms will be available in Christmas 2023's event). 
t||These usually release as one male and one female uniform. The male uniform is sold for Crystals at regular price, and is not eligible for discounts. The female uniform is "paywalled" and can only be bought with 30 event-specific tokens.
t||For the paywall tokens, 10 of these tokens are given for free, with the other 20 requiring about 20 USD of purchases to acquire. Note that these purchases will give you Crystals and other items - the tokens are applied on top of existing packs, you are not purely buying the tokens.
t||The four seasons so far are:
lp||twice||event_summer||Summer
pt||This event usually occurs as a mid-month after update x.2.[n]It has once been included in the main update of x.3 (this was update 7.3 on August 3, 2021).
lp||twice||event_halloween||Halloween
pt||This event occurs as the mid-month after update x.4, close to the actual Halloween date.
lp||twice||event_christmas||Christmas
pt||This event usually occurs as a mid-month after update x.6, close to the actual Christmas date.[n]It has once been included in the main update of x.7 (this was update 7.7 on December 22, 2021).
lp||twice||event_fools||April Fool's
pt||This event occurs as the mid-month after update x.9, close to the actual April Fool's Day.
t||Note that there are more uniforms for Summer and Christmas as these were the only two seasonal events for a couple of years.
