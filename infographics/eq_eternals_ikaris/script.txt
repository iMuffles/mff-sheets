h||Introduction
t||"Outsiders Off-Limits" is Ikaris' story within the greater "The Fate of Mankind" Epic Quest. You need to have Tier-2 Ikaris in order to start this story, and by progressing through the various stages, Ikaris reaches Tier-3.
t||It is very important to read the "Level Rebates" section below.

subp||white||gearupkit||0||no

t||Basic mission that exists purely for farming Ikaris as a Shifter - you can get 3 Ikaris Biometrics per day if he appears. This limit is not shared between Deviant Diversion and Industrial Complex (Sersi's mission).

h||Level Rebates
t||Certain stages of the Epic Quest will reward you with Ikaris level ups, for each 2 levels above 60 (and stopping at 70). However, if you have manually levelled your Ikaris to an equivalent or higher level than what the stage reward wants to give you, you will receive some materials as rebates.
t||While this doesn't really matter for a free character like Sersi, getting Premium Biometrics in bulk like this is extremely rare. As such you should level up Ikaris to Lv.70 manually and get all the level rebates, which will allow you to put those Biometrics towards Uniform Upgrades (you will have some left over, but he could always get another uniform some time down the road).
t||Whether you level Ikaris to Lv.70 before starting the quest, or level him up incrementally just before the relevant stages, you should not be letting the quest level Ikaris for you at all. It does cost more generic Biometrics than the Ikaris Biometrics you get rebated, but trading farmable ones for Premium Biometrics is really a no-brainer.

h||Search and Research
t||At various points in the Stage List, you will be asked to complete "Research" tasks which basically just require you to sacrifice some resources to progress. They are listed here in the order they appear in the Stage List (and generally, goes from easiest to hardest as you go down).
t||This Epic Quest also includes Searches. These require that you run a particular mission over and over to acquire some RNG drops. They are awful and universally despised. It is generally accepted that Search items drop at a fixed rate regardless of level (e.g. Dimension Missions having levels 1-15), so if you want to rush Search stages, run the missions with lowest Energy requirement (e.g. Dimension Mission stage 6).
