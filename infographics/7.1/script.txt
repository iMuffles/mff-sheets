h||Introduction
t||This image is intended to provide a short summary of the characters added or improved by a recent update. Use this as a recap, not a definitive guide: for more detailed reviews you may have to look elsewhere. 
t||Everything is to a degree subjective and I've tried to ensure the information here is as accurate as possible, but if I have included any completely garbage takes please let me know.
t||Please note that I am referring to the current update when discussing characters. New gamemodes and meta characters that may release in the next update are not considered, even if that update comes out before this does.
t||Thanks to proton, stro, TClord, anuswarp and Ren Vader for the help!

h||Update 7.1
t||For a quick link to the patch notes head to 21000dollor.com/patchnotes/7.1.
t||The Black Order Update was one of the biggest meta shakeups in a single update - all Black Order members, in their new original uniforms and with the added 6th skills, are extremely useful in PvE and meta in some regard (either individually or as support). Even the two support characters, Maw and Proxima, are formidable on their own. 
t||The Crystal cost of this update is simply 5 1050-cost uniforms. This adds up to 5250 Crystals.

c||(22,14,47,200)||(3,221,249)||Uniforms
t||Listed below are the new uniforms in this update. The order here is not important. For individual character details - which are more important than a ranking anyway - just read the descriptions.
t||For the characters that have also received a Tier-3 or Awakening this update, more detail is provided in the sections below.
t||The uniform options are listed from Advanced to Mythic, left-to-right, then followed by the recommended CTPs.

p||universal||proximamidnight2||Proxima Midnight [Dark Obsidian Armor]
subp||speed||punisher5||0||no
subp||blast||odin1||1||no
subp||universal||magneto2||2||no
subp||legendary||ironman5||3||no
subp||combat||valkyrie1||4||no
subp||twice||ctp_rage||5||no
subp||twice||ctp_energy||6||no
subp||twice||ctp_insight||7||yes
t||Would have been the best Universal Villain for ABX if Supergiant wasn't also in the same update. Her rotation is very proc-friendly (though a Rage is better for ABX and Dispatch) and deals excellent damage, especially given her uniform also provides a support passive and improved leadership.
t||Excellent for all PvE modes, and very nice for Dispatch as a dual Ignore Dodge lead and support, while also adding Defense Down and being controlled well by the AI. If you want her as a Dispatch character, you'd probably lean towards a Rage.
t||Tier-2 Proc Rotation: [5dc3dc4], cancel 5 when she throws the spear, cancel 3 when the row of spears appears.

p||combat||blackdwarf2||Black Dwarf [Dark Obsidian Armor]
subp||speed||shehulk3||0||no
subp||blast||beast2||1||no
subp||universal||crescent1||2||no
subp||legendary||sharonrogers3||3||no
subp||combat||scarletwitch3||4||no
subp||twice||ctp_energy||5||yes
t||A uniform with a very unique playstyle and crazy damage to back it up. While not ABX meta - Apocalypse remains on top - he puts out enough damage to be a really solid WB clearer and decent enough for other PvE modes, and works extremely well with a proc.
t||Some mild tankiness and an ignore iframe skill means he could find some viability in PvP too, although he won't be breaking into the Timeline meta.
t||Tier-2 Proc Rotation: [5c4c3], cancels are instant, then kite when the proc ends.

p||speed||corvusglaive2||Corvus Glaive [Dark Obsidian Armor]
subp||speed||sentinel1||0||no
subp||blast||thor8||1||no
subp||universal||redhulk2||2||no
subp||legendary||jeangrey2||3||no
subp||combat||invisiblewoman1||4||no
subp||twice||ctp_rage||5||no
subp||twice||ctp_energy||6||yes
t||Perhaps the least exciting of any of the new uniforms, which says more about the quality of everyone else because Corvus still gets a huge improvement, becoming ABX meta for Speed Villain and decent for Mephisto, being a Speed type.
t||Like any ABX character he benefits from a Rage, but can work with an Energy against single targets with a slight chance of missing the proc.
t||Tier-2 Proc Rotation: [5qc4] then 31 or kite.[n]Tier-2 Rage Rotation: 5qc3dc42, cancel 3 when he moves.

p||universal||supergiant1||Supergiant [Dark Obsidian Armor]
subp||speed||loki4||0||no
subp||blast||blackbolt3||1||no
subp||universal||thanos2||2||no
subp||legendary||moonknight2||3||no
subp||combat||iceman1||4||no
subp||twice||ctp_judgement||5||no
subp||twice||ctp_energy||6||yes
t||This uniform more than makes up for Supergiant not getting a uniform with the rest of the Black Order for Infinity War, making her the strongest PvE character in the game and ABX meta.
t||Her rotation is quite proc-friendly, though she truly excels with a Judgement, and is strong enough that it feels like a waste to build her without giving her one.
t||Tier-2 Proc Rotation: [4c5qc2c3].

p||blast||ebonymaw2||Ebony Maw [Dark Obsidian Armor]
subp||speed||spidergwen2||0||no
subp||blast||namor1||1||no
subp||universal||venom3||2||no
subp||legendary||silversurfer1||3||no
subp||combat||redguardian1||4||no
subp||twice||ctp_judgement||5||no
subp||twice||ctp_energy||6||no
subp||twice||ctp_insight||7||yes
t||A surprisingly high DPS uniform for a character that's traditionally been support and crowd control based. Obviously he retains his support capabilities, which have had a resurgence recently due to Molecule Man not supressing his buffs in Timeline, but has really nice damage of his own to go with it.
t||His rotation is pretty proc-friendly, though with his weird cooldowns it involves a lot of kiting and there's a chance to miss the proc every rotation. 
t||Tier-2 Proc Rotation: [4qc5c3].

c||(22,14,47,200)||(3,221,249)||New Tier-3 Advancements
t||Note that this section assumes the Dark Obsidian uniforms. Both the Tier-3s below are 1.5x cost, since they are single-cost Native Tier-2s.

lp||twice||t3_proxima||Proxima Midnight [Obsidian Shockwave]
subp||universal||proximamidnight2||0||no
subpt||1||An amazing Tier-3 which allows the first Villain-only support to enter WBL, where Proxima herself can put in work.[n]Her Ignore Dodge lead is good for WBL too, making her a diverse choice - always a support, can be a lead, and can be a main DPS.[n]Tier-3 Proc Rotation: 2c [5dc3dc4] 2c1 [5dc4dc3dc6], cancel 4 when the buffs apply the second time, other cancels the same.

lp||twice||t3_maw||Ebony Maw [Burning Doom]
subp||blast||ebonymaw2||0||no
subpt||1||Also a WBL-eligible support and lead like Proxima, but Maw's support passive will only work against Knull and not Mephisto.[n]Proxima likely takes priority, but Maw is a very competent clear on his own, and well worth Advancing if you like or want him.[n]Tier-3 Proc Rotation: [4qc5c3] kite [4qc5c6]. 

c||(22,14,47,200)||(3,221,249)||New Transcended Potential
t||Again, best uniform is assumed.

lp||twice||awaken_sugi||Supergiant [Psionic Decimation]
subp||universal||supergiant1||0||no
subpt||1||An amazing Transcend that brings Supergiant to her full potential as the top DPSer in the game and Story Mode Loki one-shotter.[n]The only issue is that her 6th skill is difficult to cancel, locking you in the animation at times.[n]Transcended Judgement Rotation: (6dc1qc) 4c5qc2c3, cancel 6 when the other two Black Order members appear.

lp||twice||awaken_dwarf||Black Dwarf [Culling Slice]
subp||combat||blackdwarf2||0||no
subpt||1||Arguably not really necessary, but a super fun character to use and strong enough to get a WBL clear out of daily.[n]Doesn't really excel in any regard but it's cool to watch him spin around and dice everything.[n]Awakened Proc Rotation: (6dc1c) 5c4c[3], cancel 6 when the other two Black Order members appear.

lp||twice||awaken_corvus||Corvus Glaive [Loyal Strike]
subp||speed||corvusglaive2||0||no
subpt||1||Necessary if you want to chase the ABX meta, or if you really like Corvus, but otherwise isn't really worth the 1.5x cost.[n]Not that Corvus is bad, but again it's just that the other two Transcended characters are insanely strong and Corvus is just "very good".[n]Awakened Proc Rotation: (6dc)[5qc4] then 31 or kite, cancel 6 when the other two Black Order members appear.
