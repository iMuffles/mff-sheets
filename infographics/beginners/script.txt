h||Introduction
t||Hello all, this is my new player guide for Marvel Future Fight version 6.4. I decided to make this as previous guides have not been updated in some time and I wanted something I could confidently point new players towards. This guide may look quite different to previous ones you have seen due to recent meta shifts, and I've made sure to get feedback from several knowledgeable players to ensure the advice is as accurate as possible.
t||Like other beginners' guides, this is primarily concerned with character selections in the first month of playtime, as that is the time it takes to complete all the new player check-in events. However I have a section down the bottom that discusses future goals past that initial month.
t||If you have questions/suggestions/corrections you can find me on reddit (/u/OwO_PinkChode_OwO) or Epic Games Launcher (dahyunnie03_OCE).  

h||Character Progression
t||Character progression is very convoluted in this game. Here is a basic rundown for the majority of characters:
t||- Unlock the character.[n]- Upgrade to 6 Stars, 6 Mastery, Lv.60.[n]- Upgrade gears to +20.[n]- Upgrade to Tier-2.[n]- Realise Potential by running World Boss.[n]- Upgrade Potential and level to Lv.70.[n]- Upgrade gears to +25.[n] > For some characters, upgrade to Tier-3.[n] > For some characters, Awaken Potential, upgrade Awakened Skill, and Transcend Potential.
t||[n]"Native Tier-2s" follow a different levelling system, but you can worry about those later.

h||Items
t||Below are some items that will be discussed later on. A lot of these can be found in the various new player check-in events.
lp||twice||item_6selector||6-Star Character Selector
pt||Brings a character straight to 6-Stars, though they will be Level 1 with no mastery.[n]You get 4 of these through new player login events.
lp||twice||item_premoselector||Premium 6-Star Character Selector
pt||Like the previous, but allows you to pick from a limited selection of Premium/Paywall characters.[n]You get 1 of these through a new player login event.
lp||twice||item_t2selector||Tier-2 Character Selector
pt||Brings a character striaght to Tier-2, which includes upgrading them to 6-Stars, maxing their Mastery, levelling them to 60 and upgrading gears to 20.[n]You get 1 of these through a new player login event.
lp||twice||item_mmt||6-Star Mega Mastery Ticket
pt||Upgrades a character's Mastery to 6-Stars instantly.[n]Less crucial who you use these on, as you can get Norn Stones relatively easily, but still use them wisely.
lp||twice||item_t2t||Tier-2 Advancement Ticket
pt||Upgrades a character to Tier-2, skipping the cost of the upgrade only.[n]You still need the character to be Lv.60, max Mastery, and gears at +20.[n]You get these every 28 days through the regular monthly check-in event.
lp||twice||item_mt2||Mega Tier-2 Advancement Ticket
pt||Upgrades any 6-Star character to Tier-2, regardless of Level, Mastery and Gear progress.[n]The character is automatically levelled to 60, fully Mastered and gears upgraded to +20 upon using a Mega Tier-2 Ticket.[n]Shortly after each update there is an event where you can get these, so you can get one in approximately every 5 weeks.

h||Character Selections
t||The characters I have recommended in this guide are chosen based on:
t||- Low-Spec Playability: How easy it is to play the character with subpar builds.[n]- Scalability into Endgame: How well the character fares in later-game content.[n]- Safety from Power Creep: Characters with high Defense Down and Support Passives are less likely to be power creeped.[n]
t||You can of course choose to just pick who you like, but following a guide like this and optimising your new player bonuses will allow you to more efficiently acquire your favourites in the future.  

h||Credits
t||Thank you to Protol, Ren Vader, Astrospeedyjm, TClord, answap and Obby for their valuable input.

c||(38,60,108,200)||(159,52,59)||Freebies
t||These are characters (and uniforms) that all new characters get for free by completing some starter content. 
p||blast||sharonrogers||Tier-2 Captain America (Sharon Rogers)
pt||From S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.
p||combat||captainamerica10||Tier-2 Captain America [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||speed||blackwidow7||Tier-2 Black Widow [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||blast||ironman7||Tier-2 Iron Man [Avengers 3099]
pt||From Story Missions, uniform included.
p||combat||taskmaster||6-Star Taskmaster
pt||From Black Widow Legendary Battle.
p||blast||mysterio||6-Star Mysterio
pt||From Spider-Man: Far From Home Legendary Battle.

t||You also get War Machine, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther and Thor at 6 Stars from Legendary Battles. I have not included separate descriptions for them as I believe none of them are currently worth building for new players, but consider levelling them to Level 60 for 60 Crystals through Achievements.

c||(224,73,64,200)||(223,210,177)||Starter Characters
t||You get a free 6-Star Selector every week for 4 weeks, and on the final day of the 28-day check-in you get a Tier-2 Selector. The "days" listed in brackets refer to the day in which you should be able to claim that reward and thus a new 6-Star or Tier-2 character.
t||Important: If a uniform sale does not align well with your Medusa pick, you can choose one of the characters from "Viable Alternatives" below instead of her, and get her later.
h||Recommended Picks
p||universal||ironhammer||Iron Hammer (Day 1)
pt||A solid all-round character with decent damage and survivability.[n]Use a Mega Mastery Ticket on him when you get it, and use his Leadership (Skill Cooldown reduction) often.[n]A really good starter character, but doesn't scale too well in late-game.
p||combat||moonknight||Moon Knight (Day 7)
pt||One of the best Physical Damage characters in the game right now, while being accessible to new players.[n]Not of much use without a uniform, but hopefully by this point you're at least close to having the 700 Crystals to afford it.[n]Amazing with the uniform alone but becomes even crazier if you Awaken and Transcend his Potential, which you can work towards gradually.
p||speed||scarletspider||Scarlet Spider (Day 14)
pt||Somewhat lacking in survivability, but has excellent damage and a good support passive at Tier-2.[n]Scales pretty well in late-game, and is able to one-shot World Boss Ultimates at respectable stage numbers.[n]Also useful for the dreaded Spider-Sense floor 32 in Shadowland.
p||universal||medusa||Medusa (Day 21)
pt||Similar to Moon Knight, Medusa is an amazing character but needs her latest uniform.[n]Medusa also has a strong Leadership, so prioritise using Mastery Tickets and/or Norn Stones to upgrade her Leadership Skill.[n]Also like Moon Knight, you can choose to Awaken/Transcend her in the future which makes her even better.
p||speed||shuri||Tier-2 Shuri (Day 28)
pt||While a barely passable character herself, Shuri's strength is in her support passive, which only unlocks at Tier-2.[n]Putting Shuri in a team will increase all characters' damage against Super Villains.[n]Support characters like Shuri are very useful in all stages of the game, especially in World Boss and Alliance Battle. 

h||Viable Alternatives
p||speed||darkhawk||Darkhawk
pt||Speed Hero that deals Energy Damage, and progresses you in the Galactic Imperative Epic Quest.
p||blast||humantorch||Human Torch
pt||Blast Hero that deals Energy/Fire Damage, which might help with Ebony Maw World Boss Ultimate, and progresses you in the First Family Epic Quest.[n]Also useful for Stage 33 Shadowland later on.
p||speed||viper||Viper
pt||Speed Villain that deals Physical/Poison Damage, helpful in Shadowland where Villains are needed.
p||universal||shadowshell||Shadow Shell
pt||Univeral Hero that deals Physical/Poison Damage, all-around very powerful but made redundant by Medusa with uniform.
p||universal||doctorvoodoo||Doctor Voodoo
pt||Universal Hero that deals Energy Damage, decent by himself but has a very useful leadership that you will use plenty in late-game PvE.
p||combat||wartiger||War Tiger
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical Damage, has nice healing and a Skill Cooldown lead, but lacks damage.
p||universal||morganlefay||Morgan le Fay
pt||Universal Villain that deals Energy Damage, has tons of mechanics like a revive, cooldown resets, and summons, but her damage sucks.

c||(42,42,58,200)||(245,90,108)||Free Premium
h||Recommended Pick
p||combat||morbius||Morbius (Day 7)
pt||A strong character on his own, but you are primarily selecting him so you can Awaken Moon Knight in the future.[n]Either through purchasing a "20 Biometrics Daily" subscription or using a Mega Tier-2 Ticket from a monthly event, you should aim to get Morbius to Tier-2.[n]The option to Awaken/Transcend Morbius himself is also open, though he is less impressive than Moon Knight.

h||Viable Alternative
p||speed||lunasnow||Luna Snow
pt||A very strong character at Tier-3, but requires late-game Custom Gear (CTP of Rage/Judgement) to truly excel.[n]At 6-Star with no uniform, no good CTP and not even Tier-2, she is not too impressive.[n]However with a uniform likely coming soon, she remains a possible option, especially if you don't like Morbius/Moon Knight.

h||Biometric Subscription Trial
t||New players also get 3 days of a "Get 20 Biometrics Daily" subscription, which can be used to select Premium characters. Since this is limited, you should use it on 3 separate characters to unlock them, ensuring you can use Rank Up / Tier-2 Tickets later on to build them up. 
t||You should select the character from the two above that you won't choose for the 6-Star Selector (either Morbius or Luna). For the next two days, get Ghost Panther and Sentinel. If you can squeeze out one extra day, consider Nick Fury or Enchantress.
p||universal||ghostpanther||Ghost Panther
pt||Decent character by himself, but his value mainly comes from the Support Passive he gains at Tier-2.[n]He is a valuable support in general but especially so for Fire Damage characters, who can take advantage of the entire passive.[n]Like Morbius, you'd want to try to get him to Tier-2 to get the value out of your pick.
p||universal||sentinel||Sentinel
pt||Useful character in late-game World Boss Ultimate with his Nimrod the Lesser uniform.
p||speed||nickfury1||Nick Fury
pt||Best support character in the game, with a transferrable buff and great leadership in combination with his support passive.[n]He is available for purchase at 6-Star for 2500 Crystals in the Captain Marvel Legendary Battle, but unlocking him gives you the option to use Rank Up Tickets.[n]However if you are quite certain you will unlock him with Crystals, skip him on this.
p||blast||enchantress||Enchantress
pt||Has a good leadership for late-game, so she could be useful to unlock for that purpose.[n]Her actual performance as a character is gated behind a paywalled and event-exclusive uniform, however.

c||(85,19,61,200)||(217,47,47)||Uniforms
t||In your first month of play you should be able to farm around 4000 Crystals from check-in events, daily challenges, and achievements for levelling characters. 
t||The below uniforms should cost 2800 Crystals (700 + 1050 + 1050), where the 700 cost comes from the new player first uniform discount. This gives you another uniform's worth of spare Crystals on top - you can spend this on Sharon's uniform if you want, or just sit on it.
t||NEVER buy a uniform unless it is on sale. All uniforms go on a 40% sale at least once per update cycle, so depending on when you start, you may have to be patient. As mentioned in "Starter Characters", the timing of a uniform sale may affect your choice to get Medusa on Day 21.
h||Recommended Picks
p||combat||moonknight2||Moon Knight [Mr. Knight]
pt||Necessary for Moon Knight to be good.[n]If you are following the recommended starter characters, try and buy this by day 7 with the new player discount.
p||speed||blackwidow9||Black Widow [Marvel's Black Widow (Snow Suit)]
pt||A huge improvement over the Avengers 3099 uniform, making Black Widow an amazing hybrid PvE/PvP character.[n]Expect her to carry you through the bulk of PvP content until you rank up Silver Surfer.[n]While not meta for endgame PvE content, she's good enough to carry her weight at Tier-3.
p||universal||medusa2||Medusa [Inhumans vs X-Men]
pt||Necessary for Medusa to be good.[n]If you are following the recommended started character, try and buy this by day 21 (but only if it is on sale).[n]Otherwise, you may want to pick a character other than Medusa for day 21, or just be patient for the next sale.

h||Viable Alternatives
p||blast||sharonrogers3||Sharon Rogers [Star Night Armor]
pt||No doubt an amazing uniform and for a character that you are given as a Tier-2 no less, vastly increasing her damage and adding a Heal.[n]However I am hesitant to recommend buying it right now as OC characters like Sharon tend to get yearly new uniforms.[n]Star Night was released last January, so it might be better to wait for a new uniform instead of buying this and having it be outdated in a few months.

c||(61,69,58,200)||(252,219,49)||Support Shop Grinds
t||The following characters' Biometrics or X-Genes can be purchased from the Support Shop in Dimension Missions.

h||Recommended Characters
t||Build these up to Tier-2, but don't expect them to be as good as the starter characters in the section above.
p||universal||vision1||Vision [Avengers: Age of Ultron]
pt||Pretty fresh character. His Age of Ultron uniform turns him Universal and is sold for Gold, making it an instant buy.[n]Especially worth building ahead of the WandaVision TV show which is expected to bring him a new uniform and a Tier-3 unlock.
p||speed||angel||Angel
pt||Darkhawk lite. Really good all-around with a fantastic uptime on damage immunity, but his damage is dated.
p||blast||bishop||Bishop
pt||Decent character in both PvE and PvP, but not amazing in any regard.
p||blast||philcoulson||Phil Coulson
pt||Get him to Tier-2 for his passive, which is still one of the best general-use support passives in the game.
p||combat||warpath||Warpath
pt||Good damage, but squishy. Very nice in Shadowland rumbles.
p||blast||mysterio||Mysterio
pt||You are already given him at 6-Star through Legendary Battle, so it's worth getting him to Tier-2 for Shadowland, which he is decent in.[n]Purchasing the uniform is also an option but shouldn't be a priority.
p||blast||crystal||Crystal
pt||Excellent crowd control character, making her useful for low levels of Shadowland even without a uniform.[n]Required at Tier-2 to Awaken Potential for Medusa.[n]Also good for Speed Villain Alliance Battle Extreme, and Speed/Villain/Human meta for Squad Battle.

h||Uniform-Required Characters
t||These characters are easily farmable in the Support Shop like the above ones, but require a uniform to be viable. You should only build these up if you have plans to buy the uniforms - for higher-paying beginners or for further down the road.
p||universal||blackbolt3||Black Bolt [Marvels X]
pt||Super strong Universal Hero with the option to be upgraded to Tier-3.[n]Plays well in PvE without any late-game Custom Gear.[n]Required at Tier-2 to Awaken Potential for Medusa.
p||speed||doctoroctopus2||Doctor Octopus [Superior Octopus]
pt||Amazing Speed Villain with the option to Awaken/Transcend Potential.[n]Another PvE character and is capable of one-shotting decently high stages in WBU.[n]Also good for Squad Battle and Alliance Battle Extreme, as he is a rare Speed Villain.

c||(253,185,246,200)||(135,35,71)||Starter Comic Cards
t||Comic Cards are boring and overly RNG-dependent but still remains the most important part of roster building as they affect your entire roster. 
t||Your aim should be to as quickly as possible build a deck of cards that brings your Skill Cooldown stat to the 28-32% range - combined with a 14% max Alliance bonus and you can effectively cut all your characters' cooldowns in half. This is essential as characters are designed with capped (50%) Skill Cooldown in mind.
t||To achieve this, create a bunch of the 5 cards below at 4-Stars - if the stats aren't right, make another 4-Star copy and repeat until it's good enough to equip. You can only equip one of each variety of card at once.
lp||twice||card_loki||LOKI: AGENT OF ASGARD #17
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: All Attack, Skill Cooldown.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed respectively.
lp||twice||card_mz||MARVEL ZOMBIES #2
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Dodge, Skill Cooldown.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Critical Damage, Ignore Defense respectively.
lp||twice||card_nebula||AVENGERS (1963) #318
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Max HP, Ignore Defense.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: All Attack, Skill Cooldown respectively.
lp||twice||card_groot||GROOT (2015) #5
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Critical Damage, Ignore Defense.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Energy Attack, Skill Cooldown respectively.
lp||twice||card_punisher||THE PUNISHER #19
pt||Obtainable from Card Chests, which can be purchased in the Dimension Mission Support Shop.[n]Fixed Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed.[n]Desired 3-Star and 4-Star Stats: Critical Damage, Skill Cooldown respectively.
t||This is quite a scrappy deck but once you have the baseline of 28-32% Skill Cooldown, you can work on optimising them. 

c||(128,212,255,200)||(162,153,73)||Going Forward

h||Character Collecting
t||Go through and pick up all of the characters under "Support Shop Grinds" and the "Starter Characters" sections that you don't have yet. If you have them below Tier-2, get them there.
t||Use Biometrics Selectors from Shadowland or otherwise to farm the characters not in the Support Shop.
t||Additionally, here are some decent characters you can find in Biometric Selectors: they weren't listed above as they are not good starter characters. 
p||blast||hydroman||Hydro-Man
pt||Blast Villain that deals Physical Damage, has excellent crowd control for Shadowland and is able to get 100k in Alliance Battle Extreme.
p||combat||moltenman||Molten Man
pt||Combat Villain that deals Physical/Fire Damage, a bit squishy but has really solid damage.
p||combat||swordmaster||Sword Master
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical Damage, cool animations but damage isn't great.
p||combat||gorillaman||Gorilla-Man
pt||Combat Hero that deals Physical/Lightning and regular Physical Damage, super tanky but only decent damage output.
p||speed||korath||Korath
pt||Speed Villain that deals Physical Damage, has good damage with a fun rotation.
p||combat||minn-erva||Minn-Erva
pt||Combat Villain that deals Physical Damage, a decent all-rounder but not excellent in any aspect.

h||Tier-3 Advancements
t||Play World Boss Ultimate to farm the materials needed for a Tier-3 Advancement. Both the below Advancements are single-cost, meaning they require 800 Cosmic Cube Fragments among other resources.
lp||twice||t3_bw||Black Widow [Mission Complete]
pt||Good damage and an accumulation buff makes this a solid Tier-3 for boosting Black Widow's PvE damage, though it definitely helps in PvP too.[n]The stat boost alone should help her take down tankier opponents in Timeline more easily.
lp||twice||t3_sharon||Captain America (Sharon Rogers) [Legendary Defender]
pt||Still one of the nuttiest PvE Tier-3 Skills in the game, with amazing base damage that makes her powerful regular rotation look weak by comparison.[n]Worth a Tier-3 as Netmarble loves their OCs and will keep Sharon up to date with the meta with roughly yearly new uniforms.

h||Awakening/Transcend Potential
t||Play Squad Battles and World Boss Ultimate to farm the materials needed for Potential Awakening/Transcendence. In addition to materials, the two characters below both require three other characters to be Tier-2 before you can Awaken their Potential - those characters are shown below.
lp||twice||awaken_mk||Moon Knight [Moonlight Hunt]
subp||white||ghostrider||0||no
subp||white||elsabloodstone||1||no
subp||white||morbius||2||no
subpt||3||Required Characters at Tier-2: Ghost Rider, Elsa Bloodstone, Morbius.[n]One of the best Awakened Skills in the game with a huge Defense Down debuff.
lp||twice||awaken_medusa||Medusa [Queen's Command]
subp||white||blackbolt||0||no
subp||white||kamalakhan||1||no
subp||white||crystal||2||no
subpt||3||Required Characters at Tier-2: Black Bolt, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Crystal.[n]An extremely powerful Awakening, making Medusa a meta one-shot character for high World Boss Ultimate.

h||Improving Cards
t||Start making higher rank cards and aim for:[n][n]- Ignore Defense at about 30%;[n]- Attack Speed at about 15%; and[n]- as much All Attack, Energy Attack and Physical Attack you can get otherwise.
t||Don't expect to get amazing cards instantly, they are a slow grind and it is extremely difficult to roll one properly. It may be best to ask for advice every time you are considering a swap until you get the hang of things.
t||Below are some cards you should try and obtain for a solid mid-game set. On slots where All Defense is recommended you can just settle for anything, Defense is not a very important stat.

lp||twice||card_ploki||LOKI #2
pt||A Premium Card, obtainable by upgrading Thor's "Ragnarok" uniform to Heroic then playing Legendary Battle.[n]Fixed Stats: Energy Attack, Ignore Defense, Skill Cooldown.[n]Desired Random Stats: Attack Speed/Critical Rate, Critical Damage, All Attack respectively.
lp||twice||card_loki||LOKI: AGENT OF ASGARD #17
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: All Attack, Skill Cooldown.[n]Desired Random Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed, All Defense, Energy Attack/Physical Attack respectively.
lp||twice||card_nebula||AVENGERS (1963) #318
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: Max HP, Ignore Defense.[n]Desired Random Stats: All Attack, Skill Cooldown, Critical Damage, Energy Attack respectively.
lp||twice||card_punisher||THE PUNISHER #19
pt||Obtainable from Card Chests, which can be purchased in the Dimension Mission Support Shop.[n]Fixed Stats: Ignore Defense, Attack Speed.[n]Desired Random Stats: Critical Damage, Skill Cooldown, All Defense, All Attack respectively.
lp||twice||card_bishop||UNCANNY X-MEN (2018) #8
pt||Obtainable from Dimension Missions.[n]Fixed Stats: All Attack, Dodge.[n]Desired Random Stats: Energy Attack, Skill Cooldown/Attack Speed, Critical Damage, Ignore Defense respectively.

h||Native Tier-2
t||Native Tier-2s are powerful and very costly characters, so your first choice should be an important one.
p||universal||silversurfer||Silver Surfer
pt||"Double Cost" Native, obtained from defeating Galactus in Giant Boss Raid (just ask good players for carries on Sunday).[n]A very formidable character in both PvP and PvE, though his main strength is in PvP modes.[n]Viable even at 6-Star and Level 60, but has a really nice uniform and Tier-3 upgrade if you want to invest further.

h||Epic Quests
t||You can make progress on all the Epic Quests if you like, and if you really love some of the characters you can focus on those respective Quests, but the below two are the ones I believe are worth focusing on the most at first.
lp||twice||eq_xmen||Rise of the X-Men
pt||This Epic Quest offers an all-around very solid assortment of characters, and is the easiest to complete due to the lack of a Shifter character.[n]The majority of characters featured in this Quest have Tier-3 upgrades available and will likely get future uniforms as they are iconic characters.[n]Deluxe Pack is recommended as it gives you a powerful character (Magneto), faster farming for Mutant Tier-2 materials, and the ability to unlock Jean Grey.
lp||twice||eq_gotg||The Galactic Imperative
pt||A difficult Quest to complete, with very high material costs, but you end up with Beta Ray Bill and a Tier-3 Star-Lord, both amazing PvE characters.[n]While her being a Shifter makes the Quest slower to complete, Phyla-Vell is also a useful support character.[n]The Deluxe Pack is nice for the rewards, but not a must-have as Nova and Gladiator are not a priority in their current state.
t||You can find my guides for these two Epic Quests at:[n]- 21000dollor.com/eq/x-men.png[n]- 21000dollor.com/eq/gotg.png

h||Optional: CTP Acquisition
t||Celestial Tech Packs (CTPs) are rare and specialised Custom Gears that can greatly enhance the performance of characters. The main method of getting guaranteed CTPs is through Legendary Battles - the two easiest are shown below.
p||twice||ctp_energy||CTP of Energy [Thor: Ragnarok]
subp||universal||hela1||0||no
subpt||1||Requirement: Upgrade Hela's "Thor: Ragnarok" uniform to Heroic. The uniform costs 750 Crystals on a 40% sale.[n]The most cost-efficient way to get a guaranteed CTP, as other Legendary Battles require you to pay Crystals to unlock the ability to get them.[n]Put this one on Moon Knight or Sharon Rogers, depending on who you want to stack the most.
p||twice||ctp_rage||CTP of Rage [Spider-Man: Far From Home]
subp||speed||spiderman||0||no
subpt||1||Requirement: Purchase the Extreme Difficulty for 2500 Crystals (500 are rebated) and Type Enhance Spider-Man to Stage 3.[n]Type Enhancing to Stage 3 is easy, so the main consideration is the Crystal cost.[n]You can put the Rage on Moon Knight if you didn't go for Energy, or save it for a character who really needs it.

h||Optional: Heroic Quest
t||Heroic Quests provide a list of tasks for you to do every week, with rewards for each one. You should always be running the free Heroic Quests, but if you are willing to put some Crystals towards one of the premium ones, get White Fox's.
p||speed||whitefox||White Fox [Fox Hunt]
pt||An okay character on her own, but her main strength comes from her debuff-boosting Leadership and her amazing support buff.

h||Character Building Tips
t||1. Do not follow the "top ranking" character builds when building your own characters. Character Ranking is an awful system that incentivises subpar builds for the sake of clout. If you are unsure of how to build a character, ask for advice, do not follow ranked builds.
t||2. Energy/Physical *Attack* and Energy/Physical *Damage* are two different things. Attack is a character stat that is used to calculate Damage, which is what is dealt during gameplay.
t||3. The vast majority of characters only depend on a single Attack stat (either Physical or Energy). They may have skills that deal a combination of Physical and Energy Damage, but these skills will scale off the same primary Attack stat. The character's primary Attack stat is the one shown under their level bar when you inspect them under "Team", and you should upgrade this Attack stat only (e.g. when deciding what Uru to equip).
t||4. Elemental Damage (i.e. Mind, Lightning, Fire, Cold, Poison) is a modifier, not a distinct damage type. All Elemental Damage has an underlying Physical or Energy Damage stat which is not shown in the skill description. This is important to understand when dealing with Reflect characters and certain PvE stage restrictions (e.g. Ebony Maw World Boss Ultimate is only weak against Elemental/Energy Damage, while Elemental/Physical Damage is ineffective).
t||5. Don't level random characters past Lv.60. Focus on 1-2 good ones at a time and take them all the way to 70. Prioritise getting characters that you plan to Tier-3 or Transcend Potential to Lv.70.
t||6. 100% method for upgrading Potential saves Gold, while the 10% method saves materials. There is about an 86% chance you save materials by using the 10% method, as you need to fail 19 times in a row in order to spend more materials than you would doing the 100% method.

h||Miscellaneous Tips
lp||twice||misc_starkstash||Tony Stark's Stash
pt||If you are willing to spend a bit of money, purchase the Stark Stash as often as you can.[n]Compared to anything else in the shop, it is by far the best Crystal deal and will allow you to progress significantly faster.
lp||twice||misc_codename||Codename Changer
pt||Use your codename changer in your inventory if you haven't already to select a username.
lp||twice||misc_alliance||Alliances
pt||Join a Level 30 Alliance for the stat boosts.[n]Try find one that is active with nice people who can give you advice.[n]There are enough Alliances out there that you shouldn't have to settle for a shitty one.
lp||twice||misc_shadowland||Shadowland
pt||Work through Shadowland as much as you can each week, which drops great rewards like Biometric Selectors.[n]Also a really nice way to gauge your roster's development and your various characters' capabilities.
lp||twice||misc_defdown||World Boss Ultimate Mechanics
pt||Learn about Defense Down mechanics, the World Boss Ultimate "Resist" mechanic, and how one-shotting works.
p||blast||weaponhex||Weapon Hex
pt||Farm Weapon Hex slowly through Dimension Missions or Danger Room (she is Premium and thus difficult to farm).[n]She is a very important character for late-game World Boss Ultimate, and you only need her at 6-Star for her utility.[n]Once you unlock her at 1-Star you can spend Rank Up Tickets to speed things up.
