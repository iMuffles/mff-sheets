h||Introduction
t||"A Modern Crisis" is Sersi's story within the greater "The Fate of Mankind" Epic Quest. You unlock a Tier-2 Sersi immediately once you start this story (or gain 384 Biometrics as compensation if you already have her Tier-2), and by progressing through the various stages, Sersi reaches Transcended Potential.

p||twice||sersi1||Industrial Complex
subp||blast||sersi||0||no
subp||white||gearupkit||1||no
subp||universal||ikaris||2||yes
t||Basic character farm mission. This mission has an individual limit of 10 character drops (but a single run that drops 2 Biometrics only counts as 1 run), so you can get at least 10 Biometrics a day from it.
t||Since they're cheap at 4 Energy (3 Energy with Stage 1 Boost Points), running this mission is a decent way to farm Uniform EXP and fodder Biometrics while maintaining a decent Bio-to-Energy ratio.
t||Additionally, you can get 3 Ikaris Biometrics per day if he appears as a Shifter. This limit is not shared between Industrial Complex and Deviant Diversion (Ikaris' mission).

h||Level Rebates
t||Certain stages of the Epic Quest will reward you with Sersi level ups, for each 2 levels above 60 (and stopping at 70). However, if you have manually levelled your Sersi to an equivalent or higher level than what the stage reward wants to give you, you will receive some materials as rebates.
t||Note that these are generally less than what you put in manually, so it is best to let Sersi be levelled up by the Epic Quest.

h||Search and Research
t||At various points in the Stage List, you will be asked to complete "Research" tasks which basically just require you to sacrifice some resources to progress. They are listed here in the order they appear in the Stage List (and generally, goes from easiest to hardest as you go down).
t||This Epic Quest also includes Searches. These require that you run a particular mission over and over to acquire some RNG drops. They are awful and universally despised. It is generally accepted that Search items drop at a fixed rate regardless of level (e.g. Dimension Missions having levels 1-15), so if you want to rush Search stages, run the missions with lowest Energy requirement (e.g. Dimension Mission stage 6).
