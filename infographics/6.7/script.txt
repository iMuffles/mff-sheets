h||Introduction
t||This image is intended to provide a short summary of the characters added or improved by a recent update. Use this as a recap, not a definitive guide: for more detailed reviews you may have to look elsewhere. 
t||Everything is to a degree subjective and I've tried to ensure the information here is as accurate as possible, but if I have included any completely garbage takes please let me know.
t||This update I have skipped the "Crystal Cost" section as it's simply 3 1050-cost unis (3150 Crystals).
t||Please note that I am referring to the current update when discussing characters.
t||For a quick link to the patch notes head to 21000dollor.com/patchnotes/6.7.
t||Thanks to proton, stro, TClord, anuswarp and IGN: Ren Vader for the help!

c||(230,221,230,200)||(171,30,30)||Characters
t||Only one new character this update, Knull, who was added in the mid-month patch.
p||universal||knull||Knull
pt||The second Native Tier-3 and without a doubt one of the best PvE characters in the game - arguably the 2nd best behind Moonstone.[n]Native Pierce and a nice proc-friendly rotation make him an incredible WBU and WBL clear, with low-hp invulnerability that lets him tank fatal attacks.[n]He can be okay in PvP too, but there is no doubt he is best utilised as a PvE character.

c||(33,57,115,200)||(191,249,255)||Uniforms
t||Listed below are the new uniforms in this update. The order here is not important: all three uniforms are useful in their own ways. For individual character details - which are more important than a ranking anyway - just read the descriptions.
t||For the characters that have also received a Tier-3 or Awakening this update, more detail is provided in the sections below.
t||The uniform options are listed from Advanced to Mythic, left-to-right.

p||universal||loki4||Loki [Agent of Asgard]
subp||speed||minn-erva1||0||no
subp||blast||doctorstrange2||1||no
subp||universal||storm1||2||no
subp||legendary||redguardian1||3||no
subp||combat||captainamerica11||4||no
subpt||5||Great uniform with excellent animations, boosting Loki's damage greatly and making him no longer reliant on summons.[n]His rotation can work with a proc, but sees a large improvement with a Rage.[n]Tier-3 improves him even further.

p||combat||valkyrie1||Valkyrie [Fearless Defenders]
subp||speed||medusa2||0||no
subp||blast||shehulk3||1||no
subp||universal||jeangrey2||2||no
subp||legendary||thor5||3||no
subp||combat||whitefox1||4||no
subpt||5||A big improvement over her outdated base look, making her both ABX meta on her own and buffing her support.[n]She excels with a Rage but isn't very proc-friendly due to low residual damage and buffs applying only at the end of her 5th.[n]Awakened Skill and Transcend Potential improve her even further.

p||universal||thor8||Thor [Herald of Thunder]
subp||speed||invisiblewoman1||0||no
subp||blast||doctoroctopus2||1||no
subp||universal||hawkeye4||2||no
subp||legendary||deadpool2||3||no
subp||combat||milesmorales1||4||no
subpt||5||Thor finally gets a powerful uni, though he is still overshadowed by Ghost Rider and Odin as a Universal Hero.[n]The uniform greatly improves his damage, changing his Tier-3 as well as his other skills.[n]While a proc can work, a Rage or Judgement is ideal to make him a good WBL clear.

c||(70,128,70,200)||(190,132,107)||New Tier-3 Advancements
t||Note that this section assumes the best uniform for each character.
t||I have not included Knull here as he is a Native Tier-3.

lp||twice||t3_loki||Loki [A Trick of Fate]
subp||universal||loki4||0||no
subpt||1||An excellent T3 that bumps Loki up into Universal Villain meta, where he can even outscore Knull.[n]Charges fast, has a cool animation and flows perfectly with his Tier-2 rotation which is really all you can ask for in a Tier-3.[n]While not easy, Loki is capable of clearing Knull with a good setup (build + team + cards).

c||(169,169,186,200)||(218,201,168)||New Transcended Potential
t||Again, best uniform is assumed.

lp||twice||awaken_valkyrie||Valkyrie [Valhalla's Defender]
subp||combat||valkyrie1||0||no
subpt||1||A great awakening animation that allows Valkyrie to enter WBL as a support, as well as boosting her to Combat Female ABX meta.[n]Needs a Rage to really shine in ABX, but for those unwilling to invest that much in her she still finds plenty of use as a support,[n][t]and in Knull you can tag her in every 30 seconds to pop her 6.

lp||twice||awaken_sif||Sif [Glorious Advance]
subp||combat||sif1||0||no
subpt||1||Nope

lp||twice||awaken_heimdall||Heimdall [Guardian Shockwave]
subp||universal||heimdall||0||no
subpt||1||Why
