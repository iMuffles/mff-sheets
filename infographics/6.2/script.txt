h||Introduction
t||This image is intended to provide a short summary of the characters affected by a recent update. Use this as a recap, not a definitive guide: for more detailed reviews you may have to look elsewhere. 
t||Everything is to a degree subjective and I've tried to ensure the information here is as accurate as possible, but if I have included any completely garbage takes please let me know.
t||For a quick link to the patch notes head to 21000dollor.com/6.2.
t||Thank u to proton for the help o3o

c||(209,69,69,200)||(233,190,53)||Characters
t||Listed below are the new characters in this update. They are roughly in order of quality but this is not a tier list so please don't crack a stiffy over it.
p||combat||redshehulk||Red She-Hulk
pt||A powerful paywall character and the current meta for Combat Female Alliance Battle.[n]Unfortunately is very tricky to play with a regular proc.
p||combat||abomination||Abomination
pt||A strong support and a decent Proxima clear (though not top 5) with a debuff increase lead.[n]Likely not worth the high cost (Danger Room exclusive) as he and the characters he supports aren't amazing as-is and will only get power creeped with time.

c||(25,114,83,200)||(26,43,43)||Uniforms
t||Listed below are the new uniforms in this update. The ordering here is not as important: I've roughly sorted it to have the uniforms that offer the most improvement first, but obviously the most improvement doesn't necessarily mean the best character overall (for example Cable is overall better than most on this list but the uniform doesn't change much so it's lower). For individual character details - which is more important than a ranking anyway - just read the descriptions.
t||For the characters that have also received a Tier-3 or Awakening this update, I go into more detail in that section below.
t||The uniform options are listed from Advanced to Mythic, left-to-right.

p||universal||odin1||Odin [All-Father]
subp||speed||thor6||0||no
subp||blast||ebonymaw1||1||no
subp||universal||cyclops3||2||no
subp||legendary||storm1||3||no
subp||combat||cable2||4||no
subpt||5||Just an absolute PvE monster with this uniform, with the highest base damage in the game.[n]Even without Tier-3 Odin is incredibly powerful with this uni, capable of soloing Galactus at level 60.

p||blast||enchantress1||Enchantress [Summer Days]
subp||speed||doctoroctopus2||0||no
subp||blast||minn-erva1||1||no
subp||universal||colossus2||2||no
subp||legendary||thing1||3||no
subp||combat||crescent1||4||no
subpt||5||Costliness aside, this is undoubtedly a fantastic uniform, improving her lead and adding a support passive[n]while improving her own viability: in WBU she can clear high Maw with a proc.

p||combat||amadeuscho2||Hulk (Amadeus Cho) [Brawn]
subp||speed||beast2||0||no
subp||blast||lunasnow2||1||no
subp||universal||rocketraccoon4||2||no
subp||legendary||captainamerica10||3||no
subp||combat||antman5||4||no
subpt||5||A big buff for the chode, greatly increasing his damage output with some nice varied animations.[n]Awakening Skill improves him even further.

p||combat||hulk6||Hulk [Immortal]
subp||speed||shehulk2||0||no
subp||blast||domino1||1||no
subp||universal||ironman7||2||no
subp||legendary||crescent1||3||no
subp||combat||warmachine5||4||no
subpt||5||A solid uniform that makes Hulk much better in both PvE and especially PvP due to his HP-to-damage skills.[n]Tier-3 improves him even further.

p||combat||shehulk3||She-Hulk [Avengers]
subp||speed||ronan2||0||no
subp||blast||sabretooth1||1||no
subp||universal||humantorch1||2||no
subp||legendary||captainmarvel4||3||no
subp||combat||vision2||4||no
subpt||5||Better than her previous uniforms but She-Hulk herself is still barely viable.[n]Her leadership remains a curse as it feels wasteful to actually use her instead of just having her lead someone better.

p||combat||redhulk2||Red Hulk [Symbiote of Vengeance]
subp||speed||hawkeye4||0||no
subp||blast||thanos3||1||no
subp||universal||redskull2||2||no
subp||legendary||mysterio1||3||no
subp||combat||blackwidow7||4||no
subpt||5||Really cool animations but not much more than a Shadowland clear.[n]This released 2 weeks after Cho who is the superior Combat Hero, and Cho isn't even as good as Namor.

p||blast||cable3||Cable [Summer Days]
subp||speed||crossbones2||0||no
subp||blast||namor1||1||no
subp||universal||nebula5||2||no
subp||legendary||apocalypse1||3||no
subp||combat||psylocke1||4||no
subpt||5||Very similar to his previous Cable & Deadpool uniform but with offensive accumulation that increases his DPS significantly.[n]Not the biggest rework but is now the top Blast Male for ABX (overtaking Star-Lord) and can cap with an Energy.


c||(168,159,159,200)||(202,159,80)||Tier-3 and Awakening
t||Note that this section assumes the best uniform for each character here.
h||New Tier-3 Advancements
lp||white||odint3||Odin [Triumph of Asgard]
subp||universal||odin||0||no
subpt||1||Insane PvE T3, meta for Ebony, Cull and Thanos WBU, as well as capping out at about 12m in ABX.[n]Pretty clearly the best PvE character in the game.

lp||white||hulkt3||Hulk [Worldbreaker Smash]
subp||combat||hulk||0||no
subpt||1||T3 skill itself isn't crazy but the stat buffs give him a ton of HP which boosts both his tankiness and damage.[n]While many have built Hulk for his tremendous PvP value (AC/AT especially), he doubles as a decent F2P substitute for Namor in Combat Villain ABX.

h||New Awakened Skill
t||The required characters to Awaken Potential are shown with a white border.
lp||white||choawaken||Hulk (Amadeus Cho) [Atlas Tactics]
subp||combat||amadeuscho||0||no
subp||white||lunasnow||1||no
subp||white||wave||2||no
subp||white||hulk||3||no
subpt||4||Really clean awakening skill that greatly boosts Cho's PvE viability alongside his uniform.[n]Gives non-uniformed Namor a run for his money on Combat Hero day and can do high Proxima with a debuff lead.

c||(69,102,44,200)||(41,17,49)||Crystal Cost
t||Below is the net Crystal cost of this update.
p||white||uniform||Uniforms: 7450 Crystals
pt||Assuming regular 40% sales, Odin costs 1500 and there are 4 1050-cost uniforms.[n]Cable did not go on sale and thus costs 1750.
p||combat||abomination||Abomination's Special Training: 3250 Crystals
pt||Costs 4500 upfront but provides 1250 back in rebates.
p||white||cash||Total: 10700 Crystals
pt||A pricey one, but luckily most of the uniforms are good-to-great and Abomination is skippable.

t||Not a crystal cost, but it should be noted that Enchantress' uniform was paywalled and required roughly 20 USD of purchases to unlock.
