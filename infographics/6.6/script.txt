h||Introduction
t||This image is intended to provide a short summary of the characters added or improved by a recent update. Use this as a recap, not a definitive guide: for more detailed reviews you may have to look elsewhere. 
t||Everything is to a degree subjective and I've tried to ensure the information here is as accurate as possible, but if I have included any completely garbage takes please let me know.
t||Please note that I am referring to the current update when discussing characters.

t||Thanks to proton, stro, TClord, anuswarp and IGN: Ren Vader for the help!

c||(78,78,86,200)||(241,216,92)||Characters
t||Listed below are the new characters in this update. They are roughly in order of quality but this is not a tier list so please don't crack a stiffy over it.
p||blast||moonstone||Moonstone
pt||Possibly the best PvE character in the game, with incredibly high DPS, high level of proc-friendliness, and a full heal each rotation.[n]Still worth grabbing even if you won't get the Crystal rebates from the Epic Quest immediately - she is worth the extra 1.5k over the other Deluxe characters.
p||universal||sentry||Sentry
pt||As to be expected from the first Native Tier-3, Sentry is an incredibly strong hybrid character.[n]His main strength is in PvP, with a debuff removal + attack lead, revive, and multiple skills that ignore GBI.[n]In PvE he is quite proc-friendly and insane for WBU with an 80% ADD cap, but needs a Rage to really shine against harder content like Knull.
p||combat||ares||Ares
pt||A pretty good Combat Hero, with the option to Transcend Potential.[n]However, being worse than Moon Knight overall while being a semi-premium and having horrible cooldowns makes him pretty redundant.
p||speed||scorpion||Scorpion
pt||Scorpion adds plenty of value to the roster of F2P characters, being a free Speed Villain that reqiures no uniform.[n]A solid Shadowland character and is capable of one-shotting low-mid Proxima WBU, but doesn't have much use in lategame.
p||universal||moleculeman||Molecule Man
pt||Has his niche uses, but isn't worth the high cost for the majority of players.[n]While a meta support for PvP, his face, fit, and damage numbers are very unfortunate.
p||combat||daken||Daken
pt||A pretty unremarkable character and isn't anywhere near meta for anything.[n]Basically just a Shadowland character, a massive pain to farm, and has one of those boring rotations where you just use the same 2 skills.

c||(214,16,33,200)||(150,142,158)||Uniforms
t||Listed below are the new uniforms in this update. The ordering here is not as important: I've roughly sorted it to have the uniforms that offer the most improvement first, but obviously the most improvement doesn't necessarily mean the best character overall. For individual character details - which is more important than a ranking anyway - just read the descriptions.
t||For the characters that have also received a Tier-3 or Awakening this update, I go into more detail in that section below.
t||The uniform options are listed from Advanced to Mythic, left-to-right.

p||speed||bullseye2||Bullseye [Dark Avengers]
subp||speed||blackwidow9||0||no
subp||blast||wolverine3||1||no
subp||universal||redskull2||2||no
subp||legendary||hulk6||3||no
subp||combat||magik1||4||no
subpt||5||A solid uniform and a massive improvement to Bullseye's previous performance, but nothing really spectacular.[n]While his damage is vastly improved, his skills aren't too proc-friendly and he still has no heal.[n]Awakened Skill and Transcend Potential improve him even further.

p||speed||whitefox2||White Fox [Lifestyle Series 2]
subp||speed||amadeuscho2||0||no
subp||blast||apocalypse1||1||no
subp||universal||cyclops3||2||no
subp||legendary||beast2||3||no
subp||combat||crescent1||4||no
subpt||5||Her new 4 gives her a permanent 98% ADD with her own lead, making her a rare lead + support + main all in one.[n]One of the easiest Proxima and Corvus clears and can even push Cull decently.[n]Unfortunately the PvE meta has now shifted to Knull, hugely diminishing the value of ADD and characters without 6th skills.

p||blast||greengoblin2||Green Goblin [Dark Avengers]
subp||speed||crossbones2||0||no
subp||blast||blackwidow7||1||no
subp||universal||redhulk2||2||no
subp||legendary||shehulk2||3||no
subp||combat||silversurfer1||4||no
subpt||5||A fun uniform with a proc-friendly rotation and really good lead/support for Dark Avengers characters.[n]Without a 6th skill he's not much more than a Shadowland and early WBU character -[n][t]even his support can't be used against Knull.

p||speed||groot4||Groot [Snowflake Festival]
subp||speed||starlord4||0||no
subp||blast||sabretooth1||1||no
subp||universal||thing1||2||no
subp||legendary||thanos3||3||no
subp||combat||rogue2||4||no
subpt||5||A disappointing Christmas uniform, especially given how good Deadpool and Cable were.[n]Has a weird delay on his 5th skill that throws off what would otherwise be a proc-friendly rotation,[n][t]is not a heal striker like regular Baby Groot, and overall just doesn't do enough to justify the full price.

c||(142,84,191,200)||(255,135,234)||New Tier-3 Advancements
#t||Note that this section assumes the best uniform for each character.
t||I have not included Sentry here as he is a Native Tier-3.

lp||twice||t3_moleman||Molecule Man [Universal Manifestation]
subp||universal||moleculeman||0||no
subpt||1||A decent upgrade, and if you've built Molecule Man to max rank you might as well go all the way.[n]Tier-3 boosts his stats enough to make him a reliable 800k+ auto in Squad Battle with a pure PvP build,[n][t]and allows him to fare a lot better as a main in Timeline.

c||(81,122,173,200)||(145,104,186)||New Transcended Potential
t||Again, best uniform is assumed.

lp||twice||awaken_moonstone||Moonstone [Moonstone Eclipse]
subp||blast||moonstone||0||no
subpt||1||Best Transcended character in the game.[n]Insanely high DPS which makes her meta for just about every PvE gamemode and the easiest Knull clear without Rage.

lp||twice||awaken_bullseye||Bullseye [Dark Precision Destruction]
subp||speed||bullseye2||0||no
subpt||1||The third addition to the roster of Transcended Speed Villains, Bullseye is likely the best of the bunch with a Rage.[n]However, Gwenom is much more proc-friendly and performs better if both have a proc -[n][t]and Bullseye not being astonishing with a Rage means Gwenom remains preferable for most players.

lp||twice||awaken_ares||Ares [Final Avenging Strike]
subp||combat||ares||0||no
subpt||1||A really good Awakening Skill for one-shotting WBU, but loses relevance with defense down not applying to Knull.[n]Better than one of those Transcends that are given to a shitty character with no uniform, but still not worth it.

c||(232,92,100,200)||(50,43,35)||Crystal Cost
t||Below is the net Crystal cost up this update.
p||white||uniform||Uniforms: 3850 Crystals
pt||Assuming regular 40% sales, Goblin and Bullseye can be bought for 1050 each.[n]Being an holiday exclusive, Snowflake Festival Groot doesn't go on sale so he costs 1750.
lp||white||deluxemission||Deluxe Pack: 5100 Crystals
pt||Costs 6600 upfront but unlocks 1500 in rebates - however note that with the high cost of the EQ researches, these Crystals might take a while to redeem.
p||white||cash||Total: 8950 Crystals
pt||A pretty expensive update overall, but that is to be expected from an Epic Quest update.[n]It helps that the Groot uni is really easy to skip.

t||Not a crystal cost, but it should be noted that the White Fox [Lifestyle Series 2] uniform was paywalled and required roughly 20 USD of purchases to unlock.
