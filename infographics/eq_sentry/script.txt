h||Introduction

t||Epic Quests are sets of story-based missions that allow you to embark on a journey with a powerful Native character, empowering them as you progress through a list of challenges.
t||The Dark Reign Epic Quest follows the story of Green Goblin and Sentry's Dark Avengers, with Sentry as the protagonist and the first Native Tier-3. Through the quest, he will be upgraded to Level 70 (though his gears do not get upgraded), at which point he can be used in gamemodes that require Tier-3 or Transcended Potential characters.
t||Like most other Epic Quests, Dark Reign includes a Deluxe Pack and a second Native Tier-2 (Molecule Man) that requires Epic Quest-related characters at various ranks to unlock.

h||Characters
t||I have used the images of the characters with their relevant uniforms if they have any, but none of them are given for free and you have to purchase them from the Uniform Store.
p||universal||sentry||Sentry
pt||The protagonist of the Epic Quest. You will gradually build him up to Level 70 as the Quest progresses.
p||blast||greengoblin2||Green Goblin
pt||Free, farmable character. Can be obtained from Support Shop, Biometrics Selectors, and farmed from Reformed Rogues.
p||speed||bullseye2||Bullseye
pt||Free, farmable character. Can be obtained from Support Shop, Biometrics Selectors, and farmed from Cutthroat Companions.
p||speed||scorpion||Scorpion
pt||Free, farmable character. Can be obtained from Biometrics Selectors and farmed from Reformed Rogues.
p||combat||daken||Daken
pt||Difficult, but farmable character. X-Genes can be obtained from Cutthroat Companions at about 10/day and shifts in the Deluxe Mission.[n]His X-Genes are otherwise Premium and cannot be found in X-Gene Selectors or Danger Room rewards.
p||combat||ares||Ares
pt||Shifter character that can only be selected from the Bio Sub, or farmed at 8 Bios per day at maximum for free (elaborated on in the Missions section).[n]It is recommended that you use Rank Up Tickets and/or Tier-2 Tickets to get Ares to 5 Stars (for Quest completion) or Tier-2 (for Molecule Man).
p||blast||moonstone||Moonstone
pt||Deluxe Pack character. Unlocked at 6 Stars when purchasing the Deluxe Pack, additional Biometrics are given as Deluxe Rewards and Deluxe Mission drops.
p||universal||moleculeman||Molecule Man
pt||Ultimate Native Tier-2. Unlocked at 1 Star when all the prerequisite characters reach their required ranks and levels.

h||Deluxe Pack
p||blast||moonstone||6 Star Moonstone
pt||Instantly unlocked when purchasing the Deluxe Pack.
lp||twice||deluxe_mission||Deluxe Mission (Playing Hero)
pt||Instantly unlocked when purchasing the Deluxe Pack.
t||Deluxe Packs are a feature of every Epic Quest except the Doctor Strange one. Every Deluxe Pack costs 6600 Crystals to purchase, and unlocks an exclusive 6 Star character as well as an exclusive playable mission upon purchase. While not necessary for the main progression of the Epic Quest itself, upgrade materials dropped by this mission are always super useful.
t||Deluxe Packs are viewed as a solid investment, since even if the character that is unlocked gets power creeped, the mission stays unlocked for you to keep farming materials at an excellent mat-to-energy ratio.
t||This Deluxe Pack's exclusive character is Moonstone, who gets unlocked at 6 Stars immediately after buying it. To get her to Tier-2, you can use a combination of the Biometrics given as Deluxe Rewards in the Epic Quest progression, and farmable Biometrics from the unlockable mission at about 20/day.
t||As mentioned, purchasing a Deluxe Pack unlocks a second "Deluxe Reward" for each stage of the Epic Quest. These can be claimed retroactively, so you can go back to stages you've already completed and collect the Deluxe Rewards even if you've progressed far prior to purchasing the Deluxe Pack. The total Deluxe Rewards are listed below.
p||blast||moonstone||400 Moonstone Biometrics
pt||Deluxe Rewards gained from progressing in the Epic Quest.[n]On average, enough to max Moonstone's gears to +20s (the average is 375) with a bit left over.
p||blast||bluenorn||630 Norn Stones of Energy
pt||Deluxe Rewards gained from progressing in the Epic Quest.[n]Enough to max out Moonstone's Mastery.
p||twice||cash||1500 Crystals
pt||Deluxe Rewards gained from progressing in the Epic Quest.[n]A decent rebate, putting the net price of the Deluxe Pack at 5100 Crystals.[n]However, note that with the difficulty of this Epic Quest in particular, it might take some time before you get all of these Crystals back.
p||twice||gold||3,000,000 Gold
pt||Deluxe Rewards gained from progressing in the Epic Quest.

subp||combat||bullseye||0||no
subp||white||gearupkit||1||yes
t||Basic character farm missions. These missions have an individual limit of 10 character drops (but a single run that drops 2 Biometrics/X-Genes only counts as 1 run), so you can get at least 10 Biometrics/X-Genes a day from these missions. Bullseye's mission drops his Biometrics at a 100% chance, but Daken's has a much lower chance of dropping, so he often requires 20+ runs to get all 10 X-Gene drops.
t||Since they're cheap at 4 Energy (3 Energy with Stage 1 Boost Points), the Bullseye mission is a decent way to farm Uniform EXP and fodder Biometrics while maintaining a decent Bio-to-Energy ratio.

subp||white||booster||2||no
subp||speed||2obelisk||3||no
subp||speed||3obelisk||4||yes
t||Both these missions have 3 entries each and drop a bunch of Gear Up Kits. The first one only drops a single 2 or 3 Star Obelisk, while the second drops one of the following: x3 1 Star Boosters, x3 2 Star Obelisks, or x2 3 Star Obelisks.
t||The main purpose of these is to farm Ares Biometrics, but the issue is that Shifters only appear roughly a third of the time (though every Shifter appearance, a Biometric drop is guaranteed).
t||If you start a mission and no Shifter appears, you can force close your game, restart it, and try the mission again until you get one. With a 1-in-3 chance of appearing, you're expecting to force close about 12 times a day for all 6 Bios, which gets really tedious but the option's there.

t||This mission is unlocked upon buying the Deluxe Pack and has a daily entry limit of 2. Each run will drop about 20 Moonstone Biometrics, a 6 Star ISO Booster, and an assortment of the other upgrade mats. None of the ISO-8 drops are mutually exclusive, so there's a decent chance you pull several of the above ISO-8 and Obelisk rewards.
t||Scorpion, Daken and Ares can appear as Shifters here. Ares is the one that matters, and you are able to force close until his Shifter appears for an additional 2 guaranteed Biometrics per day (putting the total at 8 with both "Golden Gods" missions).

c||(244,38,38,200)||(22,97,204)||Search and Research
img||center||search_research
t||At various points in the Stage List, you will be asked to complete "Research" tasks which basically just require you to sacrifice some resources to progress. They are listed here in the order they appear in the Stage List (and generally, goes from easiest to hardest as you go down).
t||This Epic Quest also includes Searches. These require that you run a particular mission over and over to acquire some RNG drops. They are awful and universally despised. It is generally accepted that Search items drop at a fixed rate regardless of level (e.g. Dimension Missions having levels 1-15), so if you want to rush Search stages, run the missions with lowest Energy requirement (e.g. Dimension Mission stage 6).

c||(79,62,153,200)||(247,239,189)||Epic Quest Collections
img||center||collection
t||Epic Quest Collections consist of random items that have a chance to drop every time you run a specific mission. Complete a Collection to receive a special reward.
t||The Dark Avengers Secret Base Collection contains 4 items, each subdivided into 3 sub-items that can be farmed from missions within the Epic Quest. Once the required amounts of all 3 sub-items for a Collection item are reached, it is marked as collected and your reward can be redeemed.
t||The amount you need of each sub-item is more or less arbitrary - they all have their own drop percentages, and some will drop in larger amounts at once than others.
